================================================================================

Solution type: 3d data checking


Number of observations:              36
Number of parameters:                 0

Degrees of freedom:                  36
Sum of squared residuals:             0.34352
Standard error of unit weight:        0.09768

The probability of an SSR this low is 0.000% (from Chi squared (36))

You may have over-estimated the errors of the data.
