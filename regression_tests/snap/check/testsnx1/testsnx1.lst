                                SOLUTION SUMMARY

================================================================================

Solution type: 3d data checking


Number of observations:              51
Number of parameters:                 0

Degrees of freedom:                  51
Sum of squared residuals:             0.36287
Standard error of unit weight:        0.08435

The probability of an SSR this low is 0.000% (from Chi squared (51))

You may have over-estimated the errors of the data.

This table lists apriori errors
Residuals outside the 95.000% confidence limit are flagged ?
Residuals outside the 99.000% confidence limit are flagged ???

Significance is based on the Normal distribution function

Rejected observations are flagged *
Observations to or from rejected stations are flagged #
Observations with redundancy less than 0.10 are flagged @

Vector residual east, north, up directions are calculated at baseline midpoint
