! The tolerances are each written as a test command, starting with the highest
! order (most stringent test) and continuing to the lowest order
!
! Each test command is followed by the name of the order (eg 2, 3), then a
! series of accuracy specifications.  The specifications can include
!
! h_abs_max  ## mm                The maximum absolute error permitted
! h_rel_to_control ## mm ## ppm   The maximum error relative to a control
!                                 station (includes a distance dependent 
!                                 component).
! h_rel ## mm ## ppm              The maximum permissible error in the
!                                 relative errors of coordinates.
! h_rel_min_abs ## mm             Coordinates with an absolute error less than
!                                 this value are assumed to pass the relative
!                                 accuracy tests.  (Provided for optimisation 
!                                 of tests)
! range ##### m                   The maximum length of line for which relative
!                                 accuracy tests are applied
! autorange                       Specifies that the maximum length for relative
!                                 accuracy tests will be based upon the distance
!                                 to the nearest control mark.
