Loading marks for SDC tests
    Station 1 is a control mark
    Station 2 is to be tested. Error H/V = 0.01000000/0.00000000 m2
    Station 3 is to be tested. Error H/V = 0.01010000/0.00000000 m2
    Station 4 is to be tested. Error H/V = 0.25000000/0.00000000 m2
    Station 5 is to be tested. Error H/V = 0.25999999/0.00000000 m2
    Station 6 is to be tested. Error H/V = 0.25999999/0.00000000 m2

Finding nearest control for each mark
    Station 2 is 400.00 m2 from control
    Station 3 is 1600.00 m2 from control
    Station 4 is 3600.00 m2 from control
    Station 5 is 6400.00 m2 from control
    Station 6 is 10000.00 m2 from control

   .. Commencing tests for order 5 took 0.00 seconds (total 0.00 seconds)
==============================================================
Running test for order 5
   Absolute accuracy maximum = 1000.000 m
   Absolute accuracy maximum to nearest control = 1000.000 m +/- 1000.0000 m/100m
   Relative accuracy by abs accuracy = 0.000 m
   Maximum range for relative accuracy test = 0.0 m
   Relative accuracy maximum = 0.300 m +/- 0.0000 m/100m
Applying absolute accuracy test
   .. Absolute accuracy test complete took 0.00 seconds (total 0.00 seconds)
Setting up array for relative accuracy tests
   .. Relative accuracy tests initiated took 0.00 seconds (total 0.00 seconds)
Applying relative accuracy test
   .. Setting up relative accuracy status took 0.00 seconds (total 0.00 seconds)
  Calculating status for each vector
  Pass 1: Using existing covariance information
   Relative accuracy pass by absolute    Vector 2 to 1 passes rel accuracy (0.01000000 < 0.01502137)
   Relative accuracy pass by absolute    Vector 3 to 1 passes rel accuracy (0.01010000 < 0.01502137)
    Vector 3 to 2 rel accuracy unavailable
   Relative accuracy fail by absolute    Station 4 fails on rel accuracy to passed station 1 (0.25000000 > 0.01502137)
   Relative accuracy fail by absolute    Station 5 fails on rel accuracy to passed station 1 (0.25999999 > 0.01502137)
   Relative accuracy fail by absolute    Station 6 fails on rel accuracy to passed station 1 (0.25999999 > 0.01502137)
   .. Completed first pass using known covariances took 0.00 seconds (total 0.00 seconds)
  Pass 2: Recording missing covariance information
    Requesting covariance 3 to 2
   .. Completed second pass requesting missing covariances took 0.00 seconds (total 0.00 seconds)
  Pass 3: Calculating missing covariance information
   Calculating covariances from decomposition
   True relative accuracy test pass    Vector 3 to 2 passes rel accuracy (0.00010000 < 0.01502137)
   .. Completed third pass using missing covariances took 0.00 seconds (total 0.00 seconds)
   .. Completed summarizing relative covariance statuses took 0.00 seconds (total 0.00 seconds)
  Status of marks
    Station 2: 2 tests: 0 bad
    Station 3: 2 tests: 0 bad
  Station 2 passes rel accuracy tests (2)
  Station 3 passes rel accuracy tests (2)
   .. Relative accuracy tests completed took 0.00 seconds (total 0.00 seconds)
