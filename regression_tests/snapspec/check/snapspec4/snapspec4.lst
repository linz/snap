Loading marks for SDC tests
    Station F0 is a control mark
    Station F1 is to be tested. Error H/V = 0.01000000/0.04000000 m2
    Station F2 is to be tested. Error H/V = 0.01010000/0.04040000 m2
    Station F3 is to be tested. Error H/V = 0.25000000/1.00000000 m2
    Station F4 is to be tested. Error H/V = 0.25999999/1.03999996 m2
    Station F5 is to be tested. Error H/V = 0.25999999/1.03999996 m2

    Station F1 is 500.00 m2 from control
    Station F2 is 2000.01 m2 from control
    Station F3 is 3604.00 m2 from control
    Station F4 is 6409.00 m2 from control
    Station F5 is 10009.00 m2 from control

Running test for order 5
 Horizontal accuracy tests
   Absolute accuracy maximum = 1000.000 m
   Absolute accuracy maximum to nearest control = 1000.000 m +/- 1000.0000 m/100m
   Relative accuracy by abs accuracy = 0.000 m
   Maximum range for relative accuracy test = 0.0 m
   Relative accuracy maximum = 0.300 m +/- 0.0000 m/100m
 Vertical accuracy tests
   Absolute accuracy maximum = 1000.000 m
   Absolute accuracy maximum to nearest control = 1000.000 m +/- 1000.0000 m/100m
   Relative accuracy by abs accuracy = 0.000 m
   Maximum range for relative accuracy test = 0.0 m
   Relative accuracy maximum = 0.300 m +/- 0.0000 m/100m
