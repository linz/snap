Loading marks for SDC tests
    Station 1 is a control mark
    Station 2 is to be tested. Error H/V = 0.01000000/0.04000000 m2
    Station 3 is to be tested. Error H/V = 0.01010000/0.04040000 m2
    Station 4 is to be tested. Error H/V = 0.25000000/1.00000000 m2
    Station 5 is to be tested. Error H/V = 0.25999999/1.03999996 m2
    Station 6 is to be tested. Error H/V = 0.25999999/1.03999996 m2

    Station 2 is 500.00 m2 from control
    Station 3 is 2000.01 m2 from control
    Station 4 is 3604.00 m2 from control
    Station 5 is 6409.00 m2 from control
    Station 6 is 10009.00 m2 from control
Maximum distance to nearest control 100.05m from 6

Running test for order 5
 Horizontal accuracy tests
   Absolute accuracy maximum = 1000.000 m
   Absolute accuracy maximum to nearest control = 1000.000 m +/- 1000.0000 m/100m
   Relative accuracy by abs accuracy = 0.000 m
   Maximum range for relative accuracy test = 0.0 m
   Relative accuracy maximum = 0.300 m +/- 0.0000 m/100m
 Vertical accuracy tests
   Absolute accuracy maximum = 1000.000 m
   Absolute accuracy maximum to nearest control = 1000.000 m +/- 1000.0000 m/100m
   Relative accuracy by abs accuracy = 0.000 m
   Maximum range for relative accuracy test = 0.0 m
   Relative accuracy maximum = 0.300 m +/- 0.0000 m/100m
