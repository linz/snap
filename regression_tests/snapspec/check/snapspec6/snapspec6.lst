Loading marks for SDC tests
    Station F0 is a control mark
    Station F1 is to be tested. Error H/V = 0.00000000/0.04000000 m2
    Station F2 is to be tested. Error H/V = 0.00000000/0.04040000 m2
    Station F3 is to be tested. Error H/V = 0.00000000/1.00000000 m2
    Station F4 is to be tested. Error H/V = 0.00000000/1.03999996 m2
    Station F5 is to be tested. Error H/V = 0.00000000/1.03999996 m2

Running test for order 5
 Vertical accuracy tests
   Absolute accuracy maximum = 1000.000 m
   Absolute accuracy maximum to nearest control = 1000.000 m +/- 1000.0000 m/100m
   Relative accuracy by abs accuracy = 0.000 m
   Relative accuracy maximum = 0.300 m +/- 0.0000 m/100m
Applying absolute accuracy test

   .. Setting up relative accuracy status took 0.00 seconds (total 0.00 seconds)
  Calculating status for each vector
   Vector F1 to F0 relative vrt accuracy fail by absolute (0.04000000 > 0.01502137)
   Station F1 fails on rel vrt accuracy to passed station F0 (0.04000000 > 0.01502137)
   Vector F2 to F0 relative vrt accuracy fail by absolute (0.04040000 > 0.01502137)
   Station F2 fails on rel vrt accuracy to passed station F0 (0.04040000 > 0.01502137)
   Vector F3 to F0 relative vrt accuracy fail by absolute (1.00000000 > 0.01502137)
   Station F3 fails on rel vrt accuracy to passed station F0 (1.00000000 > 0.01502137)
   Vector F4 to F0 relative vrt accuracy fail by absolute (1.03999996 > 0.01502137)
   Station F4 fails on rel vrt accuracy to passed station F0 (1.03999996 > 0.01502137)
