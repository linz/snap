Loading marks for SDC tests
    Station F0 is a control mark
    Station F1 is to be tested. Error H/V = 0.00010000/0.00000000 m2
    Station F2 is to be tested. Error H/V = 0.00020000/0.00000000 m2
    Station F3 is ignored
    Station F4 is to be tested. Error H/V = 0.00010000/0.00000000 m2
    Station F5 is to be tested. Error H/V = 0.00010000/0.00000000 m2

Finding nearest control for each mark
    Station F1 is 400.00 m2 from control
    Station F2 is 1600.00 m2 from control
    Station F4 is 6409.08 m2 from control
    Station F5 is 10009.09 m2 from control
Maximum distance to nearest control 100.05m from F5
   .. Identified nearest control marks took 0.00 seconds (total 0.00 seconds)

   .. Commencing tests for order 5 took 0.00 seconds (total 0.00 seconds)
==============================================================
Running test for order 5
   Absolute accuracy maximum = 1000.000 m
   Absolute accuracy maximum to nearest control = 1000.000 m +/- 1000.0000 m/100m
   Relative accuracy by abs accuracy = 0.000 m
   Maximum range for relative accuracy test = 0.0 m
   Relative accuracy maximum = 0.300 m +/- 0.0000 m/100m
