Loading marks for SDC tests
    Station 1 is a control mark
    Station 2 is to be tested. Error H/V = 0.04000000/0.00000000 m2
    Station 3 is to be tested. Error H/V = 0.04000000/0.00000000 m2
    Station 4 is to be tested. Error H/V = 0.04000000/0.00000000 m2
    Station 5 is to be tested. Error H/V = 0.04000000/0.00000000 m2
    Station 6 is to be tested. Error H/V = 0.04000000/0.00000000 m2
    Station 7 is ignored
    Station 8 is ignored
    Station 9 is to be tested. Error H/V = 0.04000000/0.00000000 m2
    Station 10 is to be tested. Error H/V = 0.04000000/0.00000000 m2
    Station 11 is to be tested. Error H/V = 0.04000000/0.00000000 m2
Finding nearest control for each mark
    Station 2 is 10400.03 m2 from control
    Station 3 is 10400.03 m2 from control
    Station 4 is 10400.03 m2 from control
    Station 5 is 10400.03 m2 from control
    Station 6 is 10400.03 m2 from control
    Station 9 is 10400.03 m2 from control
    Station 10 is 10400.03 m2 from control
    Station 11 is 10400.03 m2 from control
==============================================================
Running test for order 5
   Absolute accuracy maximum = 1000.000 m
   Absolute accuracy maximum to nearest control = 1000.000 m +/- 1000.0000 m/100m
   Relative accuracy by abs accuracy = 0.000 m
   Maximum range for relative accuracy test = 0.0 m
   Relative accuracy maximum = 0.600 m +/- 0.2000 m/100m
Applying absolute accuracy test
