Loading marks for SDC tests
    Station F0 is a control mark
    Station F10 is to be tested. Error H/V = 0.04000000/0.00000000 m2
    Station F9 is to be tested. Error H/V = 0.04000000/0.00000000 m2
    Station F8 is to be tested. Error H/V = 0.04000000/0.00000000 m2
    Station F7 is to be tested. Error H/V = 0.04000000/0.00000000 m2
    Station F6 is to be tested. Error H/V = 0.04000000/0.00000000 m2
    Station F5 is ignored
    Station F4 is ignored
    Station F3 is ignored
    Station F2 is to be tested. Error H/V = 0.04000000/0.00000000 m2
    Station F1 is to be tested. Error H/V = 0.04000000/0.00000000 m2
Finding nearest control for each mark
    Station F10 has 1 control stations within 100.00 m
    Station F9 has 1 control stations within 100.00 m
    Station F8 has 1 control stations within 100.00 m
    Station F7 has 1 control stations within 100.00 m
    Station F6 has 1 control stations within 100.00 m
    Station F2 has 1 control stations within 100.00 m
    Station F1 has 1 control stations within 100.00 m
==============================================================
Running test for order 5
   Absolute accuracy maximum = 1000.000 m
   Absolute accuracy maximum to nearest control = 1000.000 m +/- 1000.0000 m/100m
   Relative accuracy by abs accuracy = 0.000 m
   Maximum range for relative accuracy test = 0.0 m
   Relative accuracy maximum = 0.600 m +/- 0.2000 m/100m
Applying absolute accuracy test
  7 stations unassigned
