Loading marks for SDC tests
    Station F0 is a control mark
    Station F1 is to be tested. Error H/V = 0.00000000/0.00020000 m2
    Station F2 is ignored
    Station F3 is to be tested. Error H/V = 0.00000000/0.00040000 m2
    Station F4 is to be tested. Error H/V = 0.00000000/0.00080000 m2

Running test for order 5
 Vertical accuracy tests
   Absolute accuracy maximum = 1000.000 m
   Absolute accuracy maximum to nearest control = 1000.000 m +/- 1000.0000 m/100m
   Relative accuracy by abs accuracy = 0.000 m
   Maximum range for relative accuracy test = 0.0 m
   Relative accuracy maximum = 0.300 m +/- 0.0000 m/100m
