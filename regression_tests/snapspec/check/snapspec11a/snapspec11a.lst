Initiallizing SDC tests
Loading marks for SDC tests
    Station F0 is a control mark
    Station F10 is to be tested. Error H/V = 0.04000000/0.00000000 m2
    Station F9 is to be tested. Error H/V = 0.04000000/0.00000000 m2
    Station F8 is to be tested. Error H/V = 0.04000000/0.00000000 m2
    Station F7 is to be tested. Error H/V = 0.04000000/0.00000000 m2
    Station F6 is to be tested. Error H/V = 0.04000000/0.00000000 m2
    Station F5 is to be tested. Error H/V = 0.04000000/0.00000000 m2
    Station F4 is to be tested. Error H/V = 0.04000000/0.00000000 m2
    Station F3 is to be tested. Error H/V = 0.04000000/0.00000000 m2

Finding nearest control for each mark
    Station F10 is 10400.03 m2 from control
    Station F9 is 10400.03 m2 from control
    Station F8 is 10400.03 m2 from control
    Station F7 is 10400.03 m2 from control
    Station F6 is 10400.03 m2 from control
    Station F5 is 10400.03 m2 from control
    Station F4 is 10400.03 m2 from control
    Station F3 is 10400.03 m2 from control
    Station F2 is 10400.03 m2 from control
    Station F1 is 10400.03 m2 from control
Maximum distance to nearest control 101.98m from F10
==============================================================
Running test for order 5
   Absolute accuracy maximum = 1000.000 m
   Absolute accuracy maximum to nearest control = 1000.000 m +/- 1000.0000 m/100m
   Relative accuracy by abs accuracy = 0.000 m
   Maximum range for relative accuracy test = 0.0 m
   Relative accuracy maximum = 0.600 m +/- 0.2000 m/100m
Applying absolute accuracy test
