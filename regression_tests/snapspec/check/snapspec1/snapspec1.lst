Initiallizing SDC tests
Loading marks for SDC tests
    Station 1 is a control mark
    Station 2 is to be tested. Error H/V = 0.01000000/0.00000000 m2
    Station 3 is to be tested. Error H/V = 0.01010000/0.00000000 m2
    Station 4 is to be tested. Error H/V = 0.25000000/0.00000000 m2
    Station 5 is to be tested. Error H/V = 0.25999999/0.00000000 m2
    Station 6 is to be tested. Error H/V = 0.25999999/0.00000000 m2
Finding nearest control for each mark
    Station 2 is 400.00 m2 from control
    Station 3 is 1600.00 m2 from control
    Station 4 is 3600.00 m2 from control
    Station 5 is 6400.00 m2 from control
    Station 6 is 10000.00 m2 from control
==============================================================
Running test for order 5
   Absolute accuracy maximum = 1000.000 m
   Absolute accuracy maximum to nearest control = 1000.000 m +/- 1000.0000 m/100m
   Relative accuracy by abs accuracy = 0.000 m
   Maximum range for relative accuracy test = 0.0 m
   Relative accuracy maximum = 0.300 m +/- 0.0000 m/100m

Applying relative accuracy test
  Calculating status for each vector
   Vector 2 to 1 relative accuracy pass by absolute (0.01000000 < 0.01502137)
   Vector 3 to 1 relative accuracy pass by absolute (0.01010000 < 0.01502137)
   Vector 3 to 2 true relative accuracy pass (0.00010000 < 0.01502137)
   Vector 4 to 1 relative accuracy fail by absolute (0.25000000 > 0.01502137)
    Station 4 fails on rel accuracy to passed station 1 (0.25000000 > 0.01502137)
   Vector 5 to 1 relative accuracy fail by absolute (0.25999999 > 0.01502137)
    Station 5 fails on rel accuracy to passed station 1 (0.25999999 > 0.01502137)
   Vector 6 to 1 relative accuracy fail by absolute (0.25999999 > 0.01502137)
    Station 6 fails on rel accuracy to passed station 1 (0.25999999 > 0.01502137)
  Status of marks
    Station 2: 2 tests: 0 bad
    Station 3: 2 tests: 0 bad
  Station 2 passes rel accuracy tests (2)
  Station 3 passes rel accuracy tests (2)
  2 stations passed relative accuracy tests
