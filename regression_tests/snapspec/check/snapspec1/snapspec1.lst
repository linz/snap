Initiallizing SDC tests
Loading marks for SDC tests
    Station F0 is a control mark
    Station F1 is to be tested. Error H/V = 0.01000000/0.00000000 m2
    Station F2 is to be tested. Error H/V = 0.01010000/0.00000000 m2
    Station F3 is to be tested. Error H/V = 0.25000000/0.00000000 m2
    Station F4 is to be tested. Error H/V = 0.25999999/0.00000000 m2
    Station F5 is to be tested. Error H/V = 0.25999999/0.00000000 m2
Finding nearest control for each mark
    Station F1 has 1 control stations within 20.00 m
    Station F2 has 1 control stations within 40.00 m
    Station F3 has 1 control stations within 60.00 m
    Station F4 has 1 control stations within 80.00 m
    Station F5 has 1 control stations within 100.00 m
==============================================================
Running test for order 5
   Absolute accuracy maximum = 1000.000 m
   Absolute accuracy maximum to nearest control = 1000.000 m +/- 1000.0000 m/100m
   Relative accuracy by abs accuracy = 0.000 m
   Maximum range for relative accuracy test = 0.0 m
   Relative accuracy maximum = 0.300 m +/- 0.0000 m/100m

Applying relative accuracy test
  Calculating status for each vector
   Vector F1 to F0 relative accuracy pass by absolute (0.01000000 < 0.01502137)
   Vector F2 to F0 relative accuracy pass by absolute (0.01010000 < 0.01502137)
   Vector F2 to F1 true relative accuracy pass (0.00010000 < 0.01502137)
   Vector F3 to F0 relative accuracy fail by absolute (0.25000000 > 0.01502137)
   Station F3 fails on rel accuracy to passed station F0 (0.25000000 > 0.01502137)
   Vector F4 to F0 relative accuracy fail by absolute (0.25999999 > 0.01502137)
   Station F4 fails on rel accuracy to passed station F0 (0.25999999 > 0.01502137)
   Vector F5 to F0 relative accuracy fail by absolute (0.25999999 > 0.01502137)
   Station F5 fails on rel accuracy to passed station F0 (0.25999999 > 0.01502137)
  Status of marks
    Station F1: 2 tests: 0 bad
    Station F2: 2 tests: 0 bad
  Station F1 passes rel accuracy tests (2)
  Station F2 passes rel accuracy tests (2)
  2 stations passed relative accuracy tests
