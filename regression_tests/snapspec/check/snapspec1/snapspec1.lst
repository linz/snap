Initiallizing SDC tests
Loading marks for SDC tests
    Station F0 is a control mark
    Station F1 is to be tested. Error H/V = 0.01000000/0.00000000 m2
    Station F2 is to be tested. Error H/V = 0.01010000/0.00000000 m2
    Station F3 is to be tested. Error H/V = 0.25000000/0.00000000 m2
    Station F4 is to be tested. Error H/V = 0.25999999/0.00000000 m2
    Station F5 is to be tested. Error H/V = 0.25999999/0.00000000 m2
Finding nearest control for each mark
    Station F1 is 400.00 m2 from control
    Station F2 is 1600.00 m2 from control
    Station F3 is 3600.00 m2 from control
    Station F4 is 6400.00 m2 from control
    Station F5 is 10000.00 m2 from control
Maximum distance to nearest control 100.00m from F5
==============================================================
Running test for order 5
   Absolute accuracy maximum = 1000.000 m
   Absolute accuracy maximum to nearest control = 1000.000 m +/- 1000.0000 m/100m
   Relative accuracy by abs accuracy = 0.000 m
   Maximum range for relative accuracy test = 0.0 m
   Relative accuracy maximum = 0.300 m +/- 0.0000 m/100m

Applying relative accuracy test
  Calculating status for each vector
   Vector F1 to F0 relative accuracy pass by absolute (0.01000000 < 0.01502137)
   Vector F2 to F0 relative accuracy pass by absolute (0.01010000 < 0.01502137)
   Vector F2 to F1 true relative accuracy pass (0.00010000 < 0.01502137)
   Vector F3 to F0 relative accuracy fail by absolute (0.25000000 > 0.01502137)
   Station F3 fails on rel accuracy to passed station F0 (0.25000000 > 0.01502137)
   Vector F4 to F0 relative accuracy fail by absolute (0.25999999 > 0.01502137)
   Station F4 fails on rel accuracy to passed station F0 (0.25999999 > 0.01502137)
   Vector F5 to F0 relative accuracy fail by absolute (0.25999999 > 0.01502137)
   Station F5 fails on rel accuracy to passed station F0 (0.25999999 > 0.01502137)
  Status of marks
    Station F1: 2 tests: 0 bad
    Station F2: 2 tests: 0 bad
  Station F1 passes rel accuracy tests (2)
  Station F2 passes rel accuracy tests (2)
  2 stations passed relative accuracy tests
