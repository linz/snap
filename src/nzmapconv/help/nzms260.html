<h1><a name="nzms260"></a>NZMS260 map references</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>NZMS260 map references define positions in terms of the NZMS260 map sheet
on which the position appears, the grid square on that map, and the approximate position within that square.  The map sheet is entered as the primary sheet name for a map.  For example the sheet &quot;R27 ptQ27&quot; is entered as &quot;R27&quot;.  The grid is identifed by reading the two digits from the bottom (east) and from left (north) edges of the sheet for the left and bottom grid lines of the square.  For conventional 6 digit references the position within the grid square is estimated by how far across the square from the left and bottom edges the point lies.  The distance is estimated in terms of tenths of the total width and height of the square.  This is equivalent to the nearest 100 metres on the ground.
</p>
<p>
These are compiled into the final reference as SSS&nbsp;EEe&nbsp;NNn, where SSS is the map sheet, EE and NN are the grid square reference, and e and n are the position within the square. 
</p>
<p>Two variations are sometimes used.  Four digit references just define the grid square - SSS&nbsp;EE&nbsp;NN.  Eight digit references are defined by measuring the position within the square to the nearest 100th of the width and height - SSS&nbsp;EEee&nbsp;NNnn. 
</p>

<h2>Entering coordinates</h2>
<p>NZMS260 map references are entered the map sheet followed by the three east digits, then the three north digits.  These can be separated by spaces as required.  Examples would be &quot;T23 537 191&quot;, &quot;T23 537191&quot;, or &quot;T23537191&quot;.  Alternatively 4 or 8 digit reference can be entered (&quot;T23 54 19&quot;, or &quot;T23 5372 1913&quot;).</p>
