<h1><a name="nztopo50"></a>NZTopo50 map references</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>NZTopo50 map references define positions in terms of the NZTopo50 map sheet
on which the position appears, the grid square on that map, and the approximate position within that square.  The map sheet is entered as the primary sheet name for a map.  For example the sheet &quot;BD31 ptBD32&quot; is entered as &quot;BD31&quot;.  The grid is identifed by reading the two digits from the bottom (east) and from left (north) edges of the sheet for the left and bottom grid lines of the square.  For conventional 6 digit references the position within the grid square is estimated by how far across the square from the left and bottom edges the point lies.  The distance is estimated in terms of tenths of the total width and height of the square.  
</p>
<p>
These are compiled into the final reference as SSSS&nbsp;EEe&nbsp;NNn, where SSSS is the map sheet, EE and NN are the grid square reference, and e and n are the position within the square.  
</p>
<p>Two variations are sometimes used.  Four digit references just define the grid square - SSSS&nbsp;EE&nbsp;NN.  Eight digit references are defined by measuring the position within the square to the nearest 100th of the width and height - SSSS&nbsp;EEee&nbsp;NNnn. 
</p>

<h2>Entering coordinates</h2>
<p>NZMS260 map references are entered the map sheet followed by the three east digits, then the three north digits.  These can be separated by spaces as required.  Examples would be &quot;BL35 437 574&quot;, &quot;BL35 437574&quot;, or &quot;BL35437574&quot;.  Alternatively 4 or 8 digit reference can be entered (&quot;BL35 43 57&quot;, or &quot;BL35 4372 5743&quot;).</p>

<p>
NZMapConv does not check that the point is actually on the sheet specified.  So if a point on BG31 is entered with a BG32 grid reference then, provided it is close enough to the BG31 map sheet, it will still refer to the same point.  It will not generate an error if it is not on the sheet.
</p>
<h2>Converted coordinates</h2>
<p>Note that when the NZMapConv generates Topo50 coordinates it uses only the main sheet name.  So a point on &quot;BD31ptBD32&quot; will be returned as either a BD31 or BD32 map reference, depending upon which part of the sheet it is on.  
</p>
<p>
Points exactly on the border between two sheets will be arbitrarily associated with one or other sheet.  So a point exactly on the border of BE43 and BF43 may be given either a BE43 or a BF43 grid reference.  These are just two different ways of referring to the same point - there is no ambiguity in the location.
