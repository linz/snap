<h2>Converting coordinates</h2>
<p>To convert coordinates simply enter the coordinate into the appropriate 
box (according to the type of coordinate), and then press the Enter key, or click the convert button. The corresponding values in other coordinate systems will be shown in each box.  If the coordinates cannot be computed (if the position is outside the valid range for them) then the box will be left blank.</p>
<p>You can only do a conversion when the entered coordinate is valid.  So for example when you are typing in an NZMG coordinate you cannot do a conversion until both the easting and northing are entered. NZMapConv indicates that the entered coordinate is incomplete or invalid by colouring the background of the box.
</p>
<p>The program is tolerant of different ways of entering coordinates.  For example NZMS260 map references can be entered with or without spaces between the various components (eg &quot;T23537191&quot;, &quot;T23 537191&quot;, and &quot; T23 537 191 &quot; are all valid.  
Projection coordinates can be entered with the easting or northing first. 

Similarly latitudes and longitudes can be in either order, and can include just decimal degrees, degrees and minutes, or degrees, minutes, and seconds.</p>
<p>The format of the converted coordinates can be altered by changing the program options</p>

<h2>Reviewing previous coordinates</h2>

<p>You can review previously converted coordinates using the &quot;Previous&quot; and &quot;Next&quot; buttons, or equivalently by using the &quot;Page Up&quot; and &quot;Page Down&quot; keys.</p>

<h2>Changing program options</h2>
<p>The program provides options for changing the format of the converted coordinates and for changing the layout of the coordinate conversion display.  These can be accessed by clicking the &quot;Options...&quot; button.  If this is not visible (there is an option to hide the buttons), then you can access it by clicking on the icon at the top left of the window (or pressing &quot;Alt+space&quot; and selecting &quot;Options...&quot; from the system menu).</p>
