<h3>Coordinate systems</h3>
<p>Enhancement: Coordinate system codes can include an alternative reference frame code
in brackets, for example EDENTM2000(NZGD2000_20140201).</p>
<p>Enhancement: coordsys.def datums and coordinate systems can include aliases for codes, eg NZGD2000=NZGD2000_20160701.</p>

for identifying this issue.</p>
<p>Bug fix: Fixed the handling of numerical codes in station lists so that, for example, R10-R100 includes R20, rather than being treated as purely alphabetic.</p>
<h2>Release: 15 November 2016: 2.7.0</h2>
<h3>Coordinate systems</h3>
<p>Enhancement: The <a href="../coordsys/crdsys_file_format.html">coordsys.def file</a> can now include
definitions of vertical datums (in principle geoids, but can also include the 2016 local vertical
datums.  These can be used to define geoid undulations and deflections of the vertical rather than using
a geoid file.  This also means that concord can be used to convert between different vertical datums (eg
between NZVD2009 and NZVD2016, or between NZVD2016 and the local vertical datums based on it).  This 
affects in particular 
<a href="../programs/concord/index.html">concord</a>, 
<a href="../programs/snapconv/index.html">snapconv</a>,
<a href="../programs/snapgeoid/index.html">snapgeoid</a>,
as well as 
<a href="../programs/snap/index.html">snap</a> itself.
</p>

<h2>Release: 10 October 2016</h2>
<h3>Snap</h3>
<p>Enhancement: New commands 
<a href="../files/cmdcfg/cmd_reweight_observations.html">reweight_observations</a>,
<a href="../files/cmdcfg/cmd_reject_observations.html">reject_observations</a>, and
<a href="../files/cmdcfg/cmd_ignore_observations.html">ignore_observations</a> replacing the 
classification command.  These improve the readability of the command file and provide 
additional functionality for selecting observations based on multiple criteria including
observation date and stations used.</a>
<p>Enhancement: <a href="../files/cmdcfg/cmd_stn_list.html">Station lists</a> are more sophisticated 
and can select stations based on multiple criteria, for example selecting order 0 or 1 stations 
outsidels a geographical area.
</p>
<p>Enhancement: Added functionality to automatically fix or float stations horizontally or vertically.
See the <a href="../files/cmdcfg/cmd_fix.html">fix frame</a> command documentation. Also the algorithm used
to automatically reject stations is more rigorous than it used to be (based on types of observations at each
station, not just on the number of observations).  This may result in more stations being automatically 
rejected than was previously the case.
</p>
<p>Enhancement: The <a href="../files/cmdcfg/cmd_geoid.html">geoid</a> command can accept stations outside 
the extent of the geoid file.  The geoid information from these stations is unchanged.
</p>
<p>Enhancement: SNAP is now able to read SINEX data with either upper or lower triangular format covariance data.</p>
<p>Enhancement: Tidied up handling of included snap files to better handle including files in subdirectories.</p>
<p>Bug fix: Corrected handling of geoid function when input coordinate file defines ellipsoidal heights.</p>
<h3>concord</h3>
<p>Enhancement: Added support for vertical datums and converting coordinates between them (eg 
between local vertical datums and geoid datums).</p>
<h3>Snapspec</h3>
<p>Bug fix: corrected the order 2 vertical specification in the configuration file</p>

<h2>Release: 24 June 2016</h2>
<h3>Snap</h3>
<p>Enhancement: Better error handling options in station lists - options for handling ignoring stations not in coordinate file</p>
<p>Enhancement: Better error handling in classification command</p>
<p>Enhancement: Making some error messages more specific and useful</p>
<h3>snap_manager</h3>
<p>Enhancement: modified geoid handling to simplify adding new geoid models.</p>
<h3>Coordinate systems</h3>
<p>Enhancement: Adding version 20160701 of New Zealand Deformation Model and
NZGeoid2016</p>
<p>Enhancement: Including old versions of deformation model to allow conversions between versions (with care!)</p>
<p>Bug fix: Modifying geoid calculations to use bilinear rather than bicubic interpolation.  This makes the calculation consistent with the LINZ standard for geoid calculation.</p>

<h2>Release: 29 March 2016</h2>
<h3>Snap</h3>
<p>Bug fix: summarise_residuals_by option did not work correctly if not summarizing by data_type</p>
<p>Bug fix: SNAP command files could be corrupted by UTF8 byte order marker (BOM).  Updated to ignore byte order marker.</p>
<p>Bug fix: Fix for reading CSV files with more than one data type per line and first item blank.</p>
<p>Enhancement: Improved handling of XYZ format in CSV coordinate file.</p>

<h2>Release: 17 June 2015</h2>
<h3>Snap</h3>
<p>Bug fix: Fixed error reading SINEX files whereby sign of X,Y,Z coordinate values can be lost.</p>
<p>Bug fix: Fixed error in sign of 14 parameter transformations.  Clarified definition of transformations in help file.</p>
<p>Enhancement: Station codes can now be up to 15 characters long (previously this was limited to 10 characters)</p>
<p>Enhancement: Station lists can specify ranges such as 2-10 for which the start and end values do not need to
be existing codes.  Previously ranges were only valid if both endpoints were listed station.</p>
<p>Enhancement: Station lists can specify stations using a &quot;*&quot; wildcard as the last character.  For example BO* will match any station code starting BO.</p>
<h2>Release: 10 April 2015</h2>
<h3>Snap</h3>
<p>Bug fix: Fixed bug whereby the covariance matrix of grouped vector data was corrupted if one or more stations in the set are ignored.</p>
<p>Bug fix: Fixed bug whereby SNAP would still run despite errors in a command file.</p>
<p>Enhancement: Reference frames for GNSS baseline and point position data can now
include time dependent terms (rates of change of translation, scale, and orientation).
<b>Note:</b> this has required some changes to the <a href="../files/cmdcfg/cmd_reference_frame.html">reference frame</a> command which means that some old command files may need
modification to work as previously.  Also added to the reference frame options in the 
<a href="../files/cmdcfg/cmd_list.html">list</a> command.</p>
<p>Enhancement: SNAP can read observations from
    <a href="../files/data/sinex_obs_files.html">SINEX</a> files
    </p>
<p>Enhancement: SNAP has two new output formats - SINEX and JSON.  The JSON format can be directly read by scripting languages 
such as perl and python.  See details for the <a href="../files/cmdcfg/cmd_output.html">output</a> command. </p>
<p>Enhancement: Added the <a href="../files/cmdcfg/cmd_recode.html">recode</a> and <a href="../files/cmdcfg/cmd_data_file.html">data_file .. recode</a> commands to allow recoding stations read from
command file. This allows stations in data files to be recoded, optionally for specific date ranges.  This
can be used where stations are miscoded in data files, to test if stations have moved for
specific ranges of dates, and to remove observations from data files (in the same way as the ignore command).
</p>
<p>Enhancement: Added station offset file command in snap configuration, allowing a time history of 
coordinate offsets to apply at each station.</p>
<p>Enhancement: Added an option for selecting station inside or outside a polygon area in <a href="../files/cmdcfg/cmd_stn_list.html">station lists</a>.
</p>
<p>Enhancement: Added <a href="../files/cmdcfg/cmd_min_iterations.html">min_iterations</a> command.</p>
<p>Enhancement: Fixed precision of GX (GPS point position) data in output.</p>
<p>Enhancement: Increased precision of GPS datum transformation parameters.</p>
<p>Enhancement: Changed format of dumped observation equations to JSON format to more easily import into other software.</p>
<h3>snapconv</h3>
<p>Enhancement: Conversion of coordinate systems requiring conversion date.</p>
<h3>snap_manager</h3>
<p>Enhancement: Modified coordinate file conversion dialog to include conversion date.</p> 
<p>Enhancement: Improved configuration file dialog with import/export/delete.</p> 
<h3>snapplot</h3>
<p>Enhancement: Coordinate output respects coordinate precision specified in snap command file.</p>
<h3>concord</h3>
<p>Bug fix: Fixed default coordinate accuracy used for decimal lat/lon coordinates.</p>
<p>Enhancement: The command line options have been &quot;conventionalised&quot; to allow space be between the option and value.</p>
<h3>dat2site</h3>
<p>Enhancement: dat2site (calc missing stations option in snap_manager) now handles CSV formatted data when reading station and
data files from a snap command file.</p>


<h2>Release: 12 January 2015</h2>
<h3>Coordinate systems</h3>
<p>Enhancement: Updated to version 20150101 of NZGD2000 deformation model.  Extends coverage of deformation
model to include the extents of the NZ Exclusive Economic Zone.</p>
<p>Enhancement: Using a new version of the LINZ deformation model binary format that better suits the definition
of the model using nested grids rather than additive subgrids.  This means that only one grid needs to be 
evaluated at each location.</p>
<h3>Snap</h3>
<p>Bug fix: Fixed mismatch of column names and values in some output csv files</p>
<p>Enhancement: Added height_difference_error option to CSV observation file format definition.</p>
<p>Enhancement: error_type option allows specifying confidence limits for error ellipses.</p>
<h3>Snap manager</h3>
<p>Enhancement: Added option to display system configuration data from Config menu.</p>
<h3>dat2site</h3>
<p>Bug fix: Fixed bug generating log file name which could cause a program crash.</p>
<h3>Concord</h3>
<p>Bug fix: Some bug fixes where a non-blank separator is used, handling properly blanks at at the end of data
fields and copying non coordinate lines with the -E option. </p>
<h2>Release: 30 January 2014</h2>
<p>Update: the NZGD2000 deformation model has been updated to version 20140201 incorporating
the 2013 Cook Strait and Lake Grassmere earthquakes as forward patches</p>
<h2>Release: 13 January 2014 (version 2.5)</h2>
<h3>snap_manager</h3>
<p>Enhancement: Added configuration menu for managing the various types of configuration files</p>
<p>Enhancement: Updates to snap_manager scripting language.  The main feature is allowing a 
function to return multiple values.  Also additional function (MakeDir) and dialog option (new_row).
Bug fix on missing return value when return is in a foreach loop.
</p>

<h2>Release: 20 November 2013 (version 2.4)</h2>
<p>There are two main changes in this release of SNAP</p>
<ul>
	<li>Support for installing configuration information in user files, rather
	than system files, has been improved.  This has meant some reorganisation of 
	where these files are are installed, as documented in the
     <a href="../files/index.html">snap files</a> documentation.  
     As a consequence snap_manager packages for previous versions are not compatible 
     with this version.
	</li>
	<li>
	SNAP and concord have been updated to better and more consistent use of
	a deformation model, and for a deformation model including reverse patches.
	This has included time dependent transformations in concord, and including
	the epoch in SNAP coordinate systems (eg NZGD2000@2013.5). Also the coordsys.def
    file has been updated to provide more rigorous datum transformations between
    NZGD2000 and ITRF/WGS84 coordinate systems.
	</li>
</ul>

<h3>snap</h3>
<p>Enhancement: Added option calculating errors of angle errors in 
observations files based on angle error and constant error.  
(But note that this is based on the calculated length based on the 
input coordinates - it is not updated as the coordinates change at
each iteration</p>
<p>Bug fix: Obscure bug in calculating errors of residuals of 
grouped GPS vector observations when some of the vectors in the group are rejected.
</p>
<h3>snapplot</h3>
<p>Bug fix: Sorting list of observations was not working properly if the observations
did not have an observation id
</p>
<p>
Enhancement: Observations dates are more displayed in the observation lists, and
dates include times.
</p>
<h3>snap_manager</h3>
<p>
Modified GDB import to clear existing coordinate orders before importing from 
GDB by default
</p>
<h3>snapmerge</h3>
<p>
Added options to clear coordinate orders for coordinate files being merged.
</p>
<h3>snapspec</h3>
<p>Altered behaviour to not reject stations if no relative accuracy tests are 
defined.
</p>
<p>
Enhancement: concord supports time dependent Bursa-Wolf transformations, and 
also for printing additional textual information associated with coordinate 
systems and transformations.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Relase: 11 August 2011</h2>
<p><b>Note:</b> SNAP binary files have changed in this release - binary files
from old adjustments cannot be loaded and will need to be rebuilt.</p>
<h3>snap</h3>
<p>Enhancement: SNAP can read <a href="../files/crd/csv_stn_files.html">station coordinates</a> and <a href="../files/data/csv_obs_files.html">observations</a> from CSV files (character
delimited text files) as well as SNAP formatted text files.  The encoding of information
in the text files is controlled by <a href="../files/cmdcfg/csv_format_definition.html">CSV format definition</a>
 configuration files.
</p>
<p>Enhancement: SNAP can output CSV (comma separated value) 
formatted files of adjustment results 
(station/coordinate information, observation information, and adjustment metdata).  
This simplifies importing adjustment data into other analysis packages. CSV format files
are generated using the <a href="../files/cmdcfg/cmd_output_csv.html">output_csv</a> command 
in the SNAP command file.  Note that this feature is &quot;under development&quot; - the implementation is likely to change in the next release of SNAP.
</p>
<p>Enhancement: SNAP is able to calculate the geoid undulation and deflections of the vertical
from the geoid model after loading the coordinates, so that this can built into the adjustment
configuration, rather than relying on the user to run the sngeoid program.  This is done with
the <a href="../files/cmdcfg/cmd_geoid.html">geoid</a> command in the SNAP command/configuration file.
</p>
<p>
Enhancement: The coordsys.def file can include a specification for a <a href="../coordsys/crdsys_refframe_def.html">deformation model</a> associated with the datum.  
SNAP will use this model by default, unless it is overridden by a <a href="../files/cmdcfg/cmd_deformation.html">deformation</a> command in the SNAP command file.
<!--
In conjunction with this there is a currently undocumented feature in concord 
whereby the coordinate system specifications can include an epoch (eg NZGD2000@2011.0 would represent the coordinates of an NZGD2000 point at epoch 2011 (in effect the current ITRS coordinate of the point).
-->
Note that the deformation model currently included in coordsys.def is still the IGNS98 model. 
This is under development and may change with the next release.
</p>
<p>Enhancement: The handling of bearing orientation errors, distance scale errors, refraction coefficients, and vector reference frames has been modified.
Each of these previously had values defined by codes used in the data file
using #bearing_orientation_error, #distance_scale_error, #refraction_coefficient, and #reference_frame <a href="../files/data/obs_ddc_alphabetically.html">data definition commands</a> in the configuration files.  Now they can be defined
defined in terms of any <a href="../files/data/obs_classifications.html">observation classifications</a> in the data as selected by <a href="../files/cmdcfg/cmd_additional_parameter_commands.html">parameter commands</a> in the command file.
This makes it easy to test the effect of different factors on these parameters.
</p>

<p>Enhancement: SNAP observations can include an integer observation id.  This is not 
used at all by SNAP, but is displayed in outputs.  This is mainly for data from other sources, and 
allows for easy matching of the output information with the source data.  The id is defined using 
either the <a href="../files/data/obs_ddc_data.html">#data</a> command in SNAP format observation 
files, or in the <a href="../files/cmdcfg/csv_format_definition.html">CSV format definition</a> 
file for CSV formatted observations.
</p>

<p>Bug fix: Error in calculation of LINZ deformation model (this does not apply to the simple grid 
deformation model used in NZGD2000 prior to this date).</p>
<h3>snapplot</h3>
<p>Bug fix: Some observations were not displayed in the observation list</p>
<p>Bug fix: Line lengths were not displayed in observation list</p>

<h3>General</h3>
<p>Enhancement: Added the site2gps program back into the SNAP suite for distribution.</p>
<h3>snap</h3>
<p>Bug fix: Using options like order=1 in station list would pick all marks with no order defined 
if there were no stations of order 1.</p>
<p>Change: Changed configuration files for specification testing in snap and snapspec to reflect changes to
LINZ accuracy standards.</p>
<h2>Release: 24 May 2010</h2>
<h3>General</h3>
<p>Change: Removed the relationship between Camp Area datum and WGS84.  This was incorrectly assumed to
be the same as the WGS72 relationship (based on Doppler observations).  In fact the datum predates the Doppler
observations and the relationship is undefined.</p>
<h3>snap</h3>
<p>Enhancement: Added XYZ position, mean sea level distance, orthometric height and ellipsoidal height data types.</p>
<p>Enhancement: Added options for all angles and angle errors to be entered in degrees instead of 
degrees, minutes, seconds.</p>
<p>Change: The binary format used for triangulation data has been changed.  This only affects deformation models with triangulated patches.  
 Currently no such models have been published, but possible future models will use this format.  
</p>
<p>Change: Updated accuracy specifications of NZGD2000 orders in configuration files reflecting new Surveyor General 
standards.</p>
<h3>snapspec</h3>
<p>Change: Updated accuracy specifications of NZGD2000 orders in configuration files reflecting new Surveyor General

adjustment does not include a deformation model.</p>

<hr />
<h2>Release: 6 October 2009</h2>
<h3>General</h3>
<p>The NZGeoid09 geoid model replaces the previously used unofficial NZGeoid05.  This affects concord and snapgeoid.</p>
<p>The scale factor of the WGS72 coordinate system has been changed to match that in PROJ and EPSG.  This will affect calculated heights only.</p>

<h3>snap</h3>
<p>Enhancement: Added ability to use a full LINZ deformation model, including ongoing national deformation components and
local &quot;patches&quot;.</p>
<p>Enhancement: Added &quot;output decomposition&quot; option to include the Choleski decomposition of
the normal equations in the binary file (for use by snapspec instead of using the using the full covariance
matrix).</p>
<p>Enhancement: Coordinate files can now include additional columns of station classifications.  These can be used in SNAP to select groups of stations 
for processing (for example in the &quot;fix&quot; command).  They can also be used in snapplot for colour coding stations.</p>

<h3>snapplot</h3>
<p>Enhancement: added facility to allow colouring stations by classification (such as order, etc)
as well as the default colouring by usage.</p>

<h3>snapspec</h3>
<p>
Enhancement: Modified to allow use of the Choleski decomposition instead of the full coordinate covariance matrix.
Also added a number of optimisations for calculating orders.
</p>
<p>
Enhancement: Added testing of vertical as well as horizontal accuracy specifications.
</p>
<p>
Enhancement: Added &quot;limit_order&quot; and &quot;configuration&quot; commands to snapspec configuration to 
allow constrain the orders that stations can be assigned to (for example according to
mark type) and to allow configuration to be defined in multiple files.

<h3>snap_manager</h3>
<p>New: Added import from GDB function.</p>
<p>Enhancement: Added two string processing functions (Match, Replace), a date function (GetDate), 
an environment variable GetEnv() and a function to retrieve the value of a variable (GetValue)
