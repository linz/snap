<h1><a name="snap_file_locations"></a>Files used by SNAP</h1>

<p>SNAP uses a number of configuration files defining aspects of its operation such as the coordinate system 
definitions, adjustment configuration options, data file formats, and scripts used in the snap_manager program.
These are held in system and user configuration directories.  
</p>
<p>
By default the user configuration information is in subdirectories of the directory defined by the APPDATA 
environment variable at <i>%APPDATA%\linz</i>, and the system configuration directory is the <i>/config</i> subdirectory of the 
application installation directory.  Within each of these areas the files are organised into directories as follows:
</p>
<table>
    <tr>
        <td>coordsys</td>
        <td>The coordsys.def coordinate system definition file, as well as geoid files, deformation files etc.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>perl</td>
        <td>perl scripts and batch files.  If perl is available these directories are added to the PATH
        environment variable in snap_manager.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>perl\perllib</td>
        <td>perl library modules.  If perl is available these directories are added the PERL5LIB 
            environment variable in snap_manager.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>format</td>
        <td>Data format definition files (for delimited text formats such as CSV files).</td>
    </tr>

        <td>snap</td>
        <td>SNAP configuration files</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>snapplot</td>
        <td>snapplot configuration files (including colour schemes, additional menu commands, etc</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>snapscript</td>
        <td>Scripts used by snap_manager. 
            Scripts named *_menu.cfg (where * is any name) are automatically 
            loaded when snap_manager starts.
        </td>
    </tr>

    </tr>
    <tr>

		install additional menu items.</td>

	<td>Perl library items used by the package</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>

		snapplot, snaplist, and snapspec configuration sections.

<h2><a name="cfg_file_path"></a>Finding configuration files</h2>
<p>Generally if a SNAP program is looking for a 
configuration file it will look in the following locations:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>if the configuration file referenced in a snap command, then the directory of the snap command file in which it is defined.  
        If the command file is included from another command file then the directory of that command file (and so on).</li>
	<li>the current directory</li>
	<li>the appropriate configuration subdirectory of any directories specified by the SNAPDIR environment variable</li>
	<li><i>(within snap manager)</i> the appropriate subdirectory of each user package /config directory </li>
	<li>the appropriate subdirectory in the user configuration area</li>
	<li><i>(within snap manager)</i> the appropriate subdirectory of each system package /config directory </li>
	<li>the appropriate subdirectory in the system configuration area</li>
</ul>
<p>Here <i>the appropriate directory</i> refers to the directory corresponding to the type of configuration
file, for example <i>/format</i> for a delimited text format definition file.
</p>
<p>Note that when snap_manager starts it adds the /config areas of any packages to the SNAPDIR 
environment variable to ensure they are included in the search path.  These directories are not 
automatically searched by snap programs that are run outside the snap_manager environment.
</p>
