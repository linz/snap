<p>One additional column that can be included on the residual listing is the marginal detectable error (MDE).  This is smallest error that will be flagged with a given confidence.  The confidence that a bad observation will be flagged is termed the power of the test.  The mde_power command defines this power.  For example if the flag significance level (for the ?flag) is 95% and the MDE power is 80%, then the value that will be shown for an observation is the smallest error that there would need to be in the observation in order to be 80% confident that it would be flagged at the 95% significance level.</p>
