<p>The magic number command is used to modify internal program values.  Each id corresponds to a parameter.  Currently two ids, 1 and 2, are supported.  They are used to modify the numbers SNAP uses to detect a singularity in the normal equations.  id=1 is a proportional measure and id=2 is an absolute measure.  The command mulitplies these measures by value.  That is, if value is greater than one then singularities are more likely to be detected.</p>
