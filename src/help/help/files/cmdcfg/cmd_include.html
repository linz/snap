<p class="Commanddefinition">include <i>file_name</i></p>

<p>This reads additional commands from another file. The include command differs from the configuration command in that the included command file can include any command (not just configuration commands), and in that it only looks in the command file directory for the included file.  It is intended for items that may be common to a number of adjustments working with the same data.  For example it could include a list of data files.</p>

<p class="Commanddefinition">file_name</p><p class="Commanddescription">specifies the name of a file from which additional commands items will be read. This can be used for information common to a group of adjustments.  For example a set of data files can be defined in an include file.</p>

<p>Note that other files referenced in the included file, such as data files, are interpreted as relative to the 
included file, not relative to the original command file.  For example if the include file is &quot;<tt>inc/datafiles.inc</tt>&quot;
and it includes a command &quot;<tt>data_file data/traverse.dat</tt>&quot;, then snap will open the data file as &quot;<tt>inc/data/traverse.dat&quot;</tt>.</p>
