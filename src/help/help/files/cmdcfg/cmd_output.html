<h1><a name="cmd_output"></a>The output command</h1>

<p class="Commanddefinition">output <i>output_options</i></p>

<p>The output command is used to control output of the files other than the listing file.  Its syntax is very similar to that for the list command - it may be followed by several options separated by spaces.  Each option can be negated by preceding it with "no_", for example "no_binary_file".  The options that are available with the output command are:</p>

<p class="Commanddefinition">binary_file</p><p class="Commanddescription">Creates a binary file which is used by SNAPPLOT and other programs to obtain information about the adjustment for subsequent display and processing. </p>

<p class="Commanddefinition">decomposition</p><p class="Commanddescription">Includes the choleski decomposition of the normal equations in the binary file.  This may be used by analysis programs, eg <a href="../../programs/snapspec/index.html">snapspec</a>.</p>

<p class="Commanddefinition">relative_covariances [under <i>max_length</i>] [between <i>station_list</i>]</p>
<p class="Commanddescription">Includes relative station coordinate covariance information in the binary file.  
This happens by default for observed vectors.  This command can be used to suppress covariance information 
(no_relative_covariances), or to add additional vectors.  Note that additional vectors are included in the
station reordering and may affect the efficiency of the adjustment.  If all possible vectors are required then
the &quot;output all_relative_covariances&quot; option should be used as it does not affect the station reordering and the efficiency of the calculation phase of snap.  
To add vectors specify the maximum length of vector, and/or a <a href="cmd_stn_list.html">list of stations</a> between which vectors are required.
The if both options are supplied then only vectors between the listed stations and less than the maximum length
will be included.  This command can be used multiple times to compile the required vectors. 
Not that the maximum length test is based in the a priori coordinates, not on the
calculated final coordinates.  Using this can make analysis programs such as <a href="../../programs/snapspec/index.html">snapspec</a> more efficient to run.  
</p>

<p class="Commanddefinition">all_relative_covariances</p><p class="Commanddescription">Includes complete station coordinate covariance information in the binary file.  This may be used by analysis programs, eg <a href="../../programs/snapspec/index.html">snapspec</a>.  Note that for a large adjustment this can generate a very large binary file. </p>

<p class="Commanddefinition">coordinate_file</p><p class="Commanddescription">Creates a new version of the station coordinate file. </p>

<p class="Commanddefinition">rejected_station_coordinates</p><p class="Commanddescription">By default rejected and ignored stations are copied into the new coordinate file.  The can be omitted by using the no_rejected_station_coordinates option.</p>

<p class="Commanddefinition">sinex</p><p class="Commanddescription">
Creates a SINEX format file of the coordinates and covariances calculated.  Note that this
will only properly represent the solution if all stations involved in the adjustment are 
freely adjusted in three dimensions.  Constrained stations will not be included if fully
constrained.  Stations adjusted in one or two dimensions will be included, but the
covariance matrix in the SINEX file will be singular.  If the adjustment includes 
additional parameters then these will not be included in the output, so the number 
of parameters in the SOLUTION SUMMARY block of the SINEX file will not match the number
in the covariance matrix.  The SINEX solution date is based on the mid date of the 
input observations.  If the adjustment uses a deformation model or station offset file
then this may misrepresent the effective date of the coordinates.
</p>

<p class="Commanddefinition">covariance_json</p><p class="Commanddescription">
Creates a JSON formatted text file listing the station coordinates calculated and their
covariance matrix. This may be used as input to other programs.</p>

<p class="Commanddefinition">solution_json</p><p class="Commanddescription">
Creates a JSON formatted text file listing the solution parameters, statistics, and 
the covariance matrix of the solution.
</p>

<p class="Commanddefinition">covariance_matrix_file</p><p class="Commanddescription">Creates a text file listing the covariance matrix of the derived coordinates.  This may be used as input to other programs.  This is a legacy command - it is recommended that SINEX or covariance_json options are used instead.</p>
