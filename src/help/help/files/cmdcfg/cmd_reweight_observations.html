<p class="Commanddefinition">reweight_observations [<i>by_set</i>] <i>factor</i> <i>selection_criteria</i></p>

<p class="Commanddefinition">reweight_observations centroid_error <i>uncertainty</i> <i>selection_criteria</i></p>

<p>The reweight_observations command is used to reweight observations in the adjustment.
Observations can be selected based upon observation type, observation date, stations used, and <a href="../data/obs_classifications.html">observation classifications</a>.</p> 

<p>Reweighting can either specify one of:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        a scale factor <i>factor</i> by which standard errors of the selected observations is 
        multiplied.
        This is the factor applied to observation uncertainties - the square of this is 
        applied to covariances.  If multiple scale factors apply to an observation then they are 
        multiplied together.
        If &quot;by_set&quot; is specified then the scale factor will apply to the whole 
        set of observations if any of the observations in the set match the critieria.
    </li>
    <li>
       an offset error that specifies an error in the location of the equipment relative 
       to the reference point of the mark, for example plumbing errors.  
    </li>
    <li>
       an centroid error that specifies an error in the centroid of a set of GNSS 
       derived coordinates such as a SINEX file.  This error is applied to the covariance of the
       set to reflect an uncertainty location of the set relative to the reference frame.
    </li>
</ul>


<p>The offset error and centroid are experimental features which attempt to remedy 
deficiencies in the covariance information resulting from GNSS processing software 
and are only supported for data types GX (coordinate observations) 
and GB (baseline basline observations).  Centroid errors do not apply to GB observations.
For other data types the offset errors are silently ignored.
They can each be specified with horizontal and vertical error components and
are applied after scale factors have been applied.  They are specified with one of the following formats:
</p>

<p class="Commanddefinition">
offset_error <i>hv_error</i> m<br />
offset_error <i>h_error</i> <i>v_error</i> m<br />
</p>

<p>The format of <i>selection_criteria</i> is described for the <a href="cmd_reject_observations.html">reject_observations</a> command.
</p>

<p>Examples of reweighting observations are:</p>

<p class="Commandexample">reweight_observations 1.5 @data_type=HA/AZ</p>

<p class="Commandexample">reweight_observations 2.0 before 2000-01-01 using_stations inside NZGD2000 affected_area.wkt</p>

<p class="Commandexample">reweight_observations offset_error 0.01 m @data_type=GX</p>

<p>Observations can also be <a href="cmd_reject_observations.html">rejected</a> or <a href="cmd_ignore_observations.html">ignored</a> based on selection criteria.  
Rejected observations are not used to calculate coordinates but do still 
have residuals calculated, whereas ignored observations are not included in the adjustment at all.
