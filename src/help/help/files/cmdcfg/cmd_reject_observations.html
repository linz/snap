<h1><a name="cmd_reject_observations"></a>The reject_observations command</h1>

<p class="Commanddefinition">reject_observations <i>selection_criteria</i></p>

<p>The reject_observations command is used to identify observations that will be rejected from the adjustment.
Observations can be selected based upon observation type, observation date, stations used, and <a href="../data/obs_classifications.html">observation classifications</a>.</p> 

<p>Observations can also be <a href="cmd_reweight_observations.html">reweighted</a> or <a href="cmd_ignore_observations.html">ignored</a> based on selection criteria.  
Rejected observations are not used to calculate coordinates but do still 
have residuals calculated, whereas ignored observations are not included in the adjustment at all.
</p>

<p>
The selection criteria can include:
</p>

<p class="Commanddefinition">classification=value</p><p class="Commanddescription">
Specifies observations based on a classification.  The classification can be one of
&quot;<a href="../data/obs_data_types.html">data_type</a>&quot;, 
&quot;data_file&quot;, or a <a href="../data/obs_classifications.html">user defined classification</a> such as &quot;EQUIPMENT&quot;.  
For classifications other than data_file multiple values can be entered separated by &quot;/&quot; characters
(eg data_type=HA/AZ/PB). To specify values that include the &quot;/&quot; character the entire classification
value can be included in either single or double quotes, (eg equipment=&quot;Kern/DKM2&quot;).
A single classification value can also include wildcards ? which matches any single character, and * which matches any number of characters (including none).
</p>
<p class="Commanddescription">The &quot;data_type&quot; cannot include wildcards - the data type codes must be explicitly listed.
</p>
<p class="Commanddescription">
Values are interpreted slightly differently for testing &quot;data_file&quot; criteria. Data file critera can only specify one value - the &quot;/&quot; character is treated as part of a file path.  Also the wildcard characters ? and * will not match a file path delimiter (&quot;/&quot; or &quot;\&quot;).  However you can use ** to match any characters including path delimiters.  Data file criteria can be preceded by &quot;ignore_missing&quot;, &quot;warn_missing&quot;, or 
&quot;fail_missing&quot; to specify the error handling if the specified data file is not in the adjustment. 
</p>

<p class="Commanddefinition">before <i>date</i></p>
<p class="Commanddescription">Selects observations dated before the specified date.  The date can be 
formatted using the <a href="../data/obs_ddc_date.html">formats</a> used in data files, except that the
date cannot include spaces, and unknown is not valid.</p>

<p class="Commanddefinition">after <i>date</i></p>
<p class="Commanddescription">Selects observations dated after the specified date.</p>

<p class="Commanddefinition">date_unknown</p>
<p class="Commanddescription">Selects observations for which the date is not specified.</p>

<p class="Commanddefinition">using_stations <i>station_list</i> [end_stations]</p>
<p class="Commanddescription">Selects observations which connect to a station 
in the <a href="cmd_stn_list.html">station list</a>. The &quot;end_stations&quot; is only required
if the list is followed by additional selection criteria.</p>

<p class="Commanddefinition">between_stations <i>station_list</i> [end_stations]</p>
<p class="Commanddescription">Selects observations between stations 
in the <a href="cmd_stn_list.html">station list</a>. This also includes point observations at
stations in the list. The &quot;end_stations&quot; is only required
if the list is followed by additional selection criteria.</p>

<p class="Commanddefinition">all_observations</p>
<p class="Commanddescription">Selects all observations in the adjustment</p>

<p>If more than one selection criterion is specified then only observations matching all criteria will
be selected.
