<h1><a name="cmd_recode"></a>The recode command</h1>

<p class="Commanddefinition">
recode  <i>code</i> to  <i>newcode</i><br />
recode  <i>code</i> to <i>newcode</i> <i>uncertainty</i> <i>date_range</i><br />
recode  suffix <i>suffix</i> <i>uncertainty</i> <i>date_range</i> for <i>station_list</i><br />
recode  file <i>station_recode_file</i>
</p>

<p>Specifies a translation of a station code that is applied when data files are read. These translations
are applied to all files. Individual data files can be recoded using the <a href="cmd_data_file.html">data_file</a>
command.
</p>
<p>
The <i>code</i> and <i>newcode</i> define the data file code and the codes that they are recoded to in SNAP.
The <i>newcode</i> can be &quot;*&quot;, which means that the station will be ignored. Also <i>newcode</i>
can be preceded by '*' to reject all observations involving the mark.
</p>
<p>
Station recoding can be restricted to a range of dates - valid date range specifications are:
</p>
<p class="Commanddefinition">
between <i>date_from</i> and <i>date_to</i><br />
before <i>date_to</i><br />
after <i>date_from</i>
</p>
<p>
Dates are entered using the format &quot;YYYY-MM-DD&quot; or &quot;YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss&quot;.  
</p>
<p>Station recoding can also be applied to a list of files using the <i>recode suffix</i> option.  All the 
stations specified in the <a href="cmd_stn_list.html">station list</a> will be recoded by appending the suffix
to the code.  This is only applied with a date range.  
</p>
<p>
The recode command can also include an <i>uncertainty</i>.  If this is defined then it adds a pseudo observation to
the adjustment which defines that the recoded and original stations are co-located.  The uncertainty specifies
a horizontal and vertical positional error in millimetres. This option is primarily intended to represent the 
uncertainty of a deformation model for a specific tectonic event, and provides a crude stochastic model of it. 
The format is one of:
</p>
<p class="Commanddefinition">
hv_error <i>hv_error</i> m<br />
hv_error <i>h_error</i> <i>v_error</i> m<br />
disconnected<br />
</p>
<p>The recode error is only valid with a date specification as either <i>before</i> or <i>after</i> a specific date.
Where there are multiple recodings for the same suffix and date the largest one will be taken.  The disconnected 
option can be used to override any error specifications - however a specification without an error has the same effect.
</p>
<p>
Where multiple recodings with errors apply to a mark then these will be compiled into date order and each step will 
be used to define the relationship between the first and last errors.  For example if station ABCD is recoded to ABCD_0
with uncertainty 4mm on before 2011-09-22 and ABCD_1 with uncertainty 3mm before 2012-12-24 then the relationship between ABCD 
(the location after 2012-12-24) and ABCD_0 (the location before 2011-09-22) will have an uncertainty of 5mm, which is 
root mean square of the errors at each intermediate step. 
</p>

<p>The <i>station_recode_file</i> option can specify a <a href="../crd/stn_recode_file.html">station recode file</a>
containing a list of station recode specifications.
</p>

<p>Some examples of recode commands:</p>

<p class=Commanddefinition>recode ABCD to XYZ </p>
<p class=Commanddescription>Recoded all mark ABCD to XYZ</p>

<p class=Commanddefinition>recode ABCD to XYZ after 2005-05-01</p>
<p class=Commanddescription>Recoded mark ABCD to XYZ for observations dated after 1 May 2005.</p>

<p class=Commanddefinition>recode ABCD to *</p>
<p class=Commanddescription>Ignore all observations involving ABCD</p>

<p class=Commanddefinition>recode ABCD to *ABCD</p>
<p class=Commanddescription>
Reject all observations involving ABCD</p>

<p class=Commanddefinition>recode suffix _A after 2005-05-01 for inside NZTM landslip.wkt</p>
<p class=Commanddescription>
Recodes all marks inside the extents defined by the polygon defined using NZTM coordinates 
in the well known text file landslip.wkt for observations after 1 May 2005.  So for example
ABCD will be recoded to ABCD_A.  Note that stations that already have a suffix _A will not
be affected.
</p>

<p class=Commanddefinition>recode suffix _A hv_error 0.3 0.5 m before 2016-11-14 for inside NZG2000 eqzone.wkt</p>
<p class=Commanddescription>
Recodes stations in the affected area before 2016-11-14 and adds co-location observervations 
with error 0.3m horizontally and 0.5m vertically.  This assumes that a deformation model
is used which is expected to account for the movement.  The before and after locations are 
expected to be the same after accounting for the deformation model, but the model adds uncertainty
to their relative position.  To account for this uncertainty the before position is recoded with 
a suffix _A to allow a different value.
