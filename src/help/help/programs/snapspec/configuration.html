    <h1><a name="snapspec"></a>Snapspec configuration file</h1>

    <p>Snapspec uses a configuration file
        to defining the specifications
        for each order to be tested. The name of the configuration file
        can be specified on the snapspec command line - by default it is called snapspec.cfg.
        Snapspec will look for the configuration file first in the same
        directory as the snap binary file, and then in the directory in which the
        snapspec program is installed.
    </p>

    <h2>Configuration commands</h2>
    <p>
        The configuration file includes both
        general settings and the specifications of orders. It can also
        include comments on lines beginning with "!". Each setting is defined on a line in
        which the first word is the command name, and the following text define the
        command options. The file can include the following commands.
    </p>

    <p class="CommandDefinition">test <i>order accuracy_specification</i></p>
    <p class="CommandDescription">
        Each order is defined by a test command, which specifies the accuracy requirements a
        station must achieve to be assigned to that order.
        The order test commands must be ordered from the highest (most accurate)
        to lowest (least accurate) order.
    </p>
    <p class="CommandDescription">
        The accuracy specification comprises a number
        of components as defined by the <a href="algorithm.html">snapspec algorithm</a>. These are:</p>
