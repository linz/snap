<h1>site2gps - calculate a dummy gps data file</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>site2gps is a program to create a data file of "dummy" GPS observations 
between stations in a coordinate file.  This can be used to assist in 
network design before carrying out a survey.
</p>
<p>
The typical usage would include the following steps:
</p>
<p class="BulletList">
Create a SNAP coordinate file with the stations to be surveyed and their 
approximate coordinates.
</p>
<p class="BulletList">
Run site2gps to generate a data file of vectors between the stations.  This can either generate specific vectors, or all possible vectors between the stations.
Usually this would include the vectors in the proposed survey.
</p>
<p class="BulletList">
Edit the generated data file to specify the expected accuracy of the GPS observations.  
</p>
<p class="BulletList">
Create/edit a SNAP command file using the station file and data file.  This will
include specifications of which stations are to be fixed.  This will typically be a "network analysis" mode adjustment.
</p>
<p class="BulletList">
Run SNAP to determine the expected accuracies of the surveyed points.
</p>
<p class="BulletList">
Analyse the output with snapplot, snapspec, or by reviewing the listing file
to see whether the required coordinate accuracies are achieved.
</p>


<h2>Running site2gps</h2>

<p>The program requires as input a SNAP coordinate file and optionally a 
file listing the proposed observations.
</p>
<p>
The proposed observation file is a simple text file on which each line contains
a set two or more station codes (separated by space characters).  site2gps 
can generate either a multistation data set including each station in the set,
or a set of vectors between each pair of stations.
</p>
or in batch mode. In interactive mode it
can create a new coordinate file, whereas in batch mode it can only be used to
add stations to an existing coordinate file. </p>

<p>To run the program use the command</p>

<p class="Commanddefinition">site2gps [options] coord_file line_list_file output_file</p>

<p>or</p>

<p class="Commanddefinition">site2gps -a [options] coord_file output_file</p>

<p>The program can take the following options:</p>
<table>

<tr><td><p class="Commanddefinition">
-b
</p></td><td><p>
Generate individual baselines between pairs of stations rather than 
 multistation GPS observations.
</p></td></tr>

<tr><td><p class="Commanddefinition">
-c#
</p></td><td><p>
Specifies that lines less than # kilometers will not be generated
</p></td></tr>

<tr><td><p class="Commanddefinition">
-f#
</p></td><td><p>
Specifies that lines greater than # kilometers will not be generated
</p></td></tr>

<tr><td><p class="Commanddefinition">
-n#
</p></td><td><p>
Specifies that no more than n stations will be connected to each base 
station (these will be the n closest stations, not including any 
excluded by the -c parameter
</p></td></tr>

</table>
