<p>
This dialog is used to choose which stations to highlight on
the map. It is accessed from the <span class="MenuItem">Stations | Highlight stations</span> menu item.
</p>
<p>
Selected stations are displayed using the highlight colour, which may
be chosen on the <a href="key_window.html">key</a>.
</p>
<p>
This dialog displays a list of stations from which stations for highlighting
can be selected.  It also allows categories of stations to be
highlighted.
</p>


<p>The items in this dialog are:</p>
<table>

<tr>
<td>Station list</td>
<td>This displays a list of stations in the adjustment which may be 
highlighted.  The stations that are shown are highlighted in this
list (have a coloured background) will be highlighted on the map.  
Stations can be highlighted or cleared by
clicking them in this list.  Click on the column headers to sort the 
list according to name or code.
</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td>Stations to change</td>
<td>This is used to highlight or clear a set of stations based upon some criteria.  
	Stations matching the selected critera can be added or removed from the list 
	of highlighted stations using the Add and Remove buttons.  
	Other stations are unaffected - they remain
	highlighted or not as they were.
<br>
<br>
Many of the criteria 
(such as magnitude of the horizontal error,
status, and so on) compare the station attributes with a  test value.  
For most criteria
the test value is entered into the threshold box.  
<br>
<br>
For the "By status"
criteria one or more status options can be chosen.  Note that some options
are exclusive.  For example no station can be both fixed and adjusted
horizontally, so if both these options are selected, then no stations
will be affected.
<br>
<br>
Note: most of these options will not apply if a SNAP binary file
has not been loaded by snapplot when it started.

</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td>Highlight observations</td>
<td>Select how observations will be highlighted.  They can either be 
unhighlighted, highlighted if both endpoints are on highlighted stations,
or highlighted if either end connects to a highlighted station.
Other criteria for highlighting observations may be selected in the 
<a href="dlg_highlight_observations.html">highlight observations</a> dialog.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Add</td>
<td>Stations matching the "stations to change" criteria will be added to 
	the list of highlighted stations</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Remove</td>
<td>Stations matching the "stations to change" criteria will be removed to 
	the list of highlighted stations</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Clear</td>
<td>All stations will be removed from the list of highlighted stations</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Done</td>
<td>Exit the dialog box.  The map will be updated to hide the selected stations</td>
</tr>
