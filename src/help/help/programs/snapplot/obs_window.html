<h1><a name="snapplot"></a>The observations list</h1>
<img class="RightImage" src="images/sp_window_observations.png" alt="Observation list window">

<p>The observations list displays a list of observations in the adjustment.  
The columns included in this list can be selected in the <a href="dlg_obs_listing_options.html">observation listing options</a> dialog, which is displayed by
right clicking on a column heading. </p>

<p>The data can be sorted by left clicking on the column heading by which the 
data is to be sorted.</p>

<p>Clicking on the "From" station column sorts the data according to the from
station, and then the to station.  However clicking on the "To" station column
sorts the data according to the vector, rather than to station.  That is, if 
observations are observed A-B, A-C, B-A, then clicking on the "From" column will list them in that order, whereas clicking on the "To" column will list
them in the order A-B, B-A, A-C.  
</p>

<p>When sorting on a column the previous sort order is retained for rows which 
have the same value for that column</p>

<p>Left clicking on a data row selects the corresponding observation on the <a href="map_window.html">map</a>. 
If the Shift key is held down at the same time a left clicking, then the map will zoom in on the observation.
If the row is double-clicked details of the observation are shown in the <a href="details_window.html">details window</a>.
