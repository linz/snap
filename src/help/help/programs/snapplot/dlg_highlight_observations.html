<p>
The highlight observations dialog is used to highlight a set of observations on the <a href="map_window.html">map</a> according to some criteria.  
Highlighted observations are displayed in the highlight colour, which can be
changed on the <a href="key_window.html">key</a>
This dialog is accessed from the 
<span class="MenuItem">Observations | Highlight observations</span> menu item.
</p>

<p>The items in this dialog are:</p>
<table>

<tr>
<td>Don't highlight observations</td>
<td>Turn off all highlighting of observations</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Standardised residuals greater than threshold</td>
<td>Highlight observations for which the a priori 
standardised residual is greater
than the threshold value entered into the dialog.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>A posteriori standardised residual greater than threshold</td>
<td>Highlight observations for which the a priori 
standardised residual is greater
than the threshold value entered into the dialog.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Redundancy factor less than threshold</td>
<td>Highlight observations with a redundancy factor less than the
threshold value entered into the dialog.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Rejected observations</td>
<td>Highlight observations which have been explicitly rejected from
the adjustment.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Unused observations</td>
<td>Highlight observations which have not been used in the 
adjustment.  This includes rejected observations and those which
are not used because there was not enough information to calculate
coordinates of the endpoint stations.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Between highlighted stations</td>
<td>Highlight observations between highlighted stations.  Stations
are highlighted using the <a href="dlg_highlight_stations.html">highlight stations</a> dialog.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>To or from highlighted stations</td>
<td>Highlight observations which connnect to highlighted stations.  Stations
are highlighted using the <a href="dlg_highlight_stations.html">highlight stations</a> dialog.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Threshold value</td>
<td>The value used as a criteria for highlighting based on
standardised residuals or redundancy factor.</td>
</tr>
