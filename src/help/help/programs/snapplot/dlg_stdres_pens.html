<p>
The standardised residuals colours dialog is used to choose how observations are
to be coloured based on standardised residuals.  
</p>
<p>The residuals will be classified in equal 
sized groups from 0 up to a maximum residual.  For example if the maximum
is 3.00 and the number of groups is 6 then the residuals will be divided into
groups with ranges 0.0 to 0.5, 0.5 to 1.0, ... , 2.5 to 3.0.  snapplot adds
another group for residuals greater than the maximum.
</p>

<p>The items in this dialog are:</p>
<table>

<tr>
<td>Residuals to use</td>
<td>Select whether observations are to be colorued according to the 
a priori or aposteriori standardised residuals.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Maximum residual class</td>
<td>The maximum value of the standardised residual to use for 
calculating classes.
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Number of classes</td>
<td>The number of standardised residual classes (not including the
class for values greater than the maximum)
</td>
</tr>

</table>
