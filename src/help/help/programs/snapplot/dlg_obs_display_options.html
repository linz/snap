<p>
The observation display options dialog is used to control how observations
are displayed in the <a href="map_window.html">map</a>.  It is accessed from
the <span class="MenuItem">Observations | Display options</span> menu item.
</p>

<p>The items in this dialog are:</p>
<table>

<tr>
<td>Observations of the same line</td>
<td>Choose how multiple observations of the same line are displayed.  
As an example consider a line between two station on which there are 
two distance observations, one height difference, and one angle observation.
Suppose distance observations and height differences are shown in blue and
angle observations in red.
<ul>
<li>
"Merge all observations" displays just one line on the map, which may be either blue or red (arbitrarily)</li>
<li>
"Show observations with different colours separately" displays two parallel lines on the map, one blue and red"
</li>
<li>
"Show all observations separately" displays four parallel lines, three blue and one red. </li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Show one way observations with dotted line</td>
<td>If this option is selected then observations which are direction 
dependent will be displayed with a line that is solid at the instrument
station end and dotted at the target station end.  Note that this only
applies to observations such as horizontal angles, where it is significant
which end is the target and which is the instrument</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Show observations to and from hidden stations</td>
<td>If this is selected then observations will be displayed even if the endpoint
 stations are hidden. 
Stations are hidden with the <a href="dlg_hideshow_stations.html">hide stations</a> dialog.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Offset between observations</td>
<td>Determines the spacing between observations where more than one is shown on the same line.  This is entered as a scale factor for a default spacing.</td>
</tr>

</table>
