<p>
The snapplot key window is used to select colours for each feature on the map
and to select which features are displayed.  Each feature may have an associated
colour and a checkbox. 
</p>
<p>To hide or display a feature click the check box.  Some features may
be represented by more than one check box.  For example a horizontal angle
 observation in the adjustment will be affected by the 
"horizontal angle" check box, and the "Used obs" checkbox.  
It will only be displayed if both are selected.
</p>
<p>To change the colour of a feature, position the mouse over the colour box,
and hold down the the left mouse button.  This will give display a colour
palette.  Drag the mouse to a new colour, and release the button to 
select it.
<p>

<p>Additional colours can be added to the palette using the 
<span class="MenuItem">View | Add colour to palette</span> menu item.
<p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<p>The following features may be included in the key:</p>
<table>
<tr>
<td>Free stations<br>Hor fixed stns<br>...</td>
<td>This has a category for each usage of station in the adjustment
(free (adjusted), fixed (constrained), or rejected).  Rejected stations
are those that are explicitly rejected in the snap command file,
or automatically rejected because there are insufficient observations
to calculate their coordinates.
The colour box is used to choose the colour of the station symbol (if it
is displayed).
Note that hiding a group of stations with the check box may also hide all the
obserations to and from those stations.  This behaviour is controlled by
the <a href="dlg_obs_display_options.html">display options</a> dialog.
Note also that stations may be shown or hidden with the <a href="dlg_hideshow_stations.html">hide stations</a> dialog.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Symbol<br>Name<br>Code</td>
<td>Chooses whether symbols, names, or codes are displayed for each station</td>
</tr>
<td>
<tr>
<td>Error ellipses<br>...</td>
<td>Controls the display of error ellipses of stations, relative error
ellipses of observed lines between stations, vertical error bars and relative
error bars, and station adjustments (changes to stations coordinates).  The 
scaling of errors is controlled by the <a href="dlg_error_options.html">error options</a> dialog.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>OBSERVATIONS</td>
<td>The categories of observations displayed may be changed using the
<span class="MenuItem">Observations | colour coding</span> menu item.  
They can be coded by observation type, data file, size of residual,
redundancy, or any observation classifications.  The key will always 
provide options for hiding or showing each observation data type.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Used obs<br>Rejected obs<br>Unused obs</td>
<td>Used obs are observations used to calculate coordinates, or contributing
to the adjustment statistics.  Rejected obs are observations explicitly 
rejected in the data file. Unused obs are observations which are not used
in the adjustment because they are to automatically rejected stations.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>BACKGROUND</td>
<td>General features of the map.  Additionally if background
<a href="background.html">background</a> graphical features have been
added to the plot their display options will be shown here.
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Map background</td>
<td>Changes the colour used for the map background.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Text</td>
<td>Changes the colour used for text (station names or codes).  This colour is also used for the border of station symbols.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Highlight</td>
<td>Selects the colour used to highlight stations and observations (highlighted
stations are selected with the <a href="dlg_highlight_stations.html">highlight stations</a> dialog, highlighted observations are selected with the 
<a href="dlg_highlight_observations.html">highlight observations</a> dialog).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Selected</td>
<td>Selects the colour used to represent the selected station or observation.
</td>
</tr>
