<img class="NoWrapImage" src="images/sp_dlg_hideshow_stations.png" alt="Picture of hide stations dialog">


<p>
This dialog is used to choose which stations to hide and which to show on
the map. It is accessed from the <span class="MenuItem">Stations | Hide stations</span> menu item.
</p>
<p>
When a station is hidden then the station symbol, code, and name
will not be displayed.
The observations to and from hidden stations may also be hidden.
</p>
<p>
Note that the <a href="key_window.html">key</a> can also be used to select
some categories of stations to hide or show.  Stations will only be shown if
they are selected in both the key and in this dialog.
</p>
<p>
This dialog displays a list of stations from which hidden stations
can be selected.  It also allows categories of stations to be
shown or hidden.
</p>


<p>The items in this dialog are:</p>
<table>

<tr>
<td>Station list</td>
<td>This displays a list of stations in the adjustment which may be 
shown or hidden.  The stations that are shown are highlighted in this
list (have a coloured background) will be hidden on the map.  
Stations can be hidden or shown by
clicking them in this list.  Click on the column headers to sort the 
list according to name or code.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Stations to change</td>
<td>This is
	used to hide or show a set of stations based upon some criteria.  
	Stations matching the selected criteria can be added or removed from
	the list of hidden stations using the "Add" and "Remove" buttons.
	Other stations are unaffected - they remain hidden or shown as they
	were.
<br>
<br>
Many of the criteria 
(such as magnitude of the horizontal error,
status, and so on) compare the station attributes with a  test value.  
For most criteria
the test value is entered into the threshold box.  
<br>
<br>
For the "By status"
criteria one or more status options can be chosen.  Note that some options
are exclusive.  For example no station can be both fixed and adjusted
horizontally, so if both these options are selected, then no stations
will be affected.
<br>
<br>
Note: most of these options will not apply if a SNAP binary file
has not been loaded by snapplot when it started.
