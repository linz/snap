<h1><a name="snapplot"></a>The map window</h1>

<img class="RightImage" src="images/sp_window_map.png" alt="Map window">
<p>
The map window has three main components:
</p>
<p class="BulletList">the map, displaying stations, observations, error ellipses, vertical error bars, adjustment vectors, and background features.</p>
<p class="BulletList">the <a href="key_window.html">key</a> used to display choose which features are displayed, and what colours to use</p>
<p class="BulletList">the coordinate window, which shows the coordinates of the cursor, and the
code and name of the station that the cursor is over, if any</p>
<h2>Using the map window</h2>
<p>The map window is mainly operated using the mouse (or other pointing 
device).  The following descriptions
use the term "click" to mean briefly click a mouse button while the cursor is
is located over a fixed point, and "drag" to mean move the mouse cursor from 
one point to another while holding a mouse button down.  The mouse buttons
are referred to as left and right.  So for example left+click a point means
position the cursor over a point, and click the left mouse button.
</p>
<p>Some of the mouse operations are affected by holding down
 the Shift, Alt, and Ctrl keys on the keyboard at the same time.
For example, Ctrl+Shift+left+drag means drag the cursor while holding 
down the left mouse button, and the Ctrl and Shift keys on the keyboard!
</p>

will be shown in the <a href="details_window.html">details</a> window. Left+click on the selected station will "lock" it, so that clicking other stations
will select the vector from the locked station to it.  Left+click on a locked
station to unlock it.  Hold the Shift key down when selecting a station or
observation to zoom in to it when it is selected.

<tr>
<td>Offset a station</td>
<td>Mouse: Shift+Ctrl+Left+drag to move a station to a different position.
Note: this only affects where the station is displayed on the map, not its
coordinates.  This is used to 
clarify the view of the network where stations are very close.

<td>Mouse: Shift+Ctrl+Right+click on a station will set its offset
back to zero.

<h2>Getting information about stations and observations</h2>
<p>The map window interacts with the text windows (station/observation lists
and details window) in a number of ways. </p>
<p>Left+clicking on a station or observation will give detailed information
about it in the details window.  The map shows the selected station or
observation with a yellow outline</p>
<img src="images/sp_eg_selected_mark.png" alt="highlighted mark">
<img src="images/sp_eg_selected_obs.png" alt="highlighted observation">
<p>Whenever the station or observation in the details window changes, the 
corresponding station or observation is highlighted on the map</p>
<p>Station and observations can also be selected by click them in 
the station/observation lists or on hyperlinks in the details window.
Holding the shift key down while selecting stations or observations will
cause the map window to zoom into the chosen item.</p>


<h2>Changing the information displayed</h2>

<p>There are several ways to change the information displayed on the

</p>
<p class="BulletList">
