<img class="RightImage" src="images/sp_window_map.png" alt="Map window">
<p>
The map window has three main components:
</p>
<p class="BulletList">the map, displaying stations, observations, error ellipses, vertical error bars, adjustment vectors, and background features.</p>
<p class="BulletList">the <a href="key_window.html">key</a> used to display choose which features are displayed, and what colours to use</p>
<p class="BulletList">the coordinate window, which shows the coordinates of the cursor, and the
code and name of the station that the cursor is over, if any</p>
<h2>Using the map window</h2>
<p>The map window is mainly operated using the mouse (or other pointing 
device).  The following descriptions
use the term "click" to mean briefly click a mouse button while the cursor is
is located over a fixed point, and "drag" to mean move the mouse cursor from 
one point to another while holding a mouse button down.  The mouse buttons
are referred to as left and right.  So for example left+click a point means
position the cursor over a point, and click the left mouse button.
</p>
<p>Some of the mouse operations are affected by holding down
 the Shift, Alt, and Ctrl keys on the keyboard at the same time.
For example, Ctrl+Shift+left+drag means drag the cursor while holding 
down the left mouse button, and the Ctrl and Shift keys on the keyboard!
</p>

will be shown in the <a href="details_window.html">details</a> window. Left+click on the selected station will "lock" it, so that clicking other stations
will select the vector from the locked station to it.  Left+click on a locked
station to unlock it.  Hold the Shift key down when selecting a station or
observation to zoom in to it when it is selected.

<td>Offset a station</td>
<td>Mouse: Shift+Ctrl+Left+drag to move a station to a different position.
Note: this only affects where the station is displayed on the map, not its
coordinates.  This is used to 
clarify the view of the network where stations are very close.

back to zero.

<h2>Getting information about stations and observations</h2>
<p>The map window interacts with the text windows (station/observation lists
and details window) in a number of ways. </p>
<p>Left+clicking on a station or observation will give detailed information
about it in the details window.  The map shows the selected station or
observation with a yellow outline</p>
<img src="images/sp_eg_selected_mark.png" alt="highlighted mark">
<img src="images/sp_eg_selected_obs.png" alt="highlighted observation">
<p>Whenever the station or observation in the details window changes, the 
corresponding station or observation is highlighted on the map</p>
<p>Station and observations can also be selected by click them in 
the station/observation lists or on hyperlinks in the details window.
Holding the shift key down while selecting stations or observations will
cause the map window to zoom into the chosen item.</p>


<h2>Changing the information displayed</h2>

<p>There are several ways to change the information displayed on the
