<h1>Regular expression syntax</h1>
<p>A <i>regular expression</i> describes character strings of
characters by patterns of characters that the string may contain.
This is used in snap manager scripting for the delimiter in the
foreach statement, and as expressions in the Match and Replace
functions. These can be used to extract information from and
replace components of text strings.</p>
<p>This documentation is not a tutorial on regular expressions - it
is a reference on the particular syntax used in snap_manager. The
regular expression syntax used in snap_manager scripts comes from
the <a href="http://www.wxwidgets.org">wxWidgets</a> library that
snap_manager is built with. Much of this documentation below is
extracted verbatim from the wxWidgets documentation. The snap
manager implementation uses what are called "Advanced regular
expressions" (ARE) in wxWidgets.</p>

<h2>Regular Expression Syntax</h2>
<p>These regular expressions are implemented using the package
written by Henry Spencer, based on the 1003.2 spec and some (not
quite all) of the Perl5 extensions. Much of the description of
regular expressions below is copied verbatim from his manual
entry.</p>
<p>A regular expression is one or more <i>branches</i>, separated
by '<b>|</b>', matching anything that matches any of the
branches.</p>
<p>A branch is zero or more <i>constraints</i> or <i>quantified
atoms</i>, concatenated. It matches a match for the first, followed
by a match for the second, etc; an empty branch matches the empty
string.</p>
<p>A quantified atom is an <i>atom</i> possibly followed by a
single <i>quantifier</i>. Without a quantifier, it matches a match
for the atom. The quantifiers, and what a so-quantified atom
matches, are:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="158"><b>*</b></td>
<td valign="top">a sequence of 0 or more matches of the atom</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="158"><b>+</b></td>
<td valign="top">a sequence of 1 or more matches of the atom</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="158"><b>?</b></td>
<td valign="top">a sequence of 0 or 1 matches of the atom</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="158"><b>{m}</b></td>
<td valign="top">a sequence of exactly <i>m</i> matches of the
atom</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="158"><b>{m,}</b></td>
<td valign="top">a sequence of <i>m</i> or more matches of the
atom</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="158"><b>{m,n}</b></td>
<td valign="top">a sequence of <i>m</i> through <i>n</i>
(inclusive) matches of the atom; <i>m</i> may not exceed
<i>n</i></td>

<tr>
<td valign="top" width="158"><b>*? +? ?? {m}? {m,}? {m,n}?</b></td>
<td valign="top"><i>non-greedy</i> quantifiers, which match the
same possibilities, but prefer the smallest number rather than the
largest number of matches (see <a href=
"resyntax.html#wxresynmatching">Matching</a>)</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The forms using <b>{</b> and <b>}</b> are known as
<i>bound</i>s. The numbers <i>m</i> and <i>n</i> are unsigned
decimal integers with permissible values from 0 to 255 inclusive.
An atom is one of:</p>
<table>

<td valign="top">where <i>x</i> is a single character with no other

</table>
<p>A <i>constraint</i> matches an empty string when specific
conditions are met. A constraint may not be followed by a
quantifier. The simple constraints are as follows; some more
constraints are described later, under <a href=
"resyntax.html#wxresynescapes">Escapes</a>.</p>

<td valign="top" width="158"><b>(?!re)</b></td>
<td valign="top"><i>negative lookahead</i> matches at any point

</table>
<p>The lookahead constraints may not contain back references (see

non-capturing.</p>
<p>An RE may not end with '<b>\</b>'.</p>

<h2>Bracket Expressions</h2>
<p>A <i>bracket expression</i> is a list of characters enclosed in
'<b>[]</b>'. It normally matches any single character from the list
(but see below). If the list begins with '<b>^</b>', it matches any
single character (but see below) <i>not</i> from the rest of the
list.</p>
<p>If two characters in the list are separated by '<b>-</b>', this
is shorthand for the full <i>range</i> of characters between those
two (inclusive) in the collating sequence, e.g. <b>[0-9]</b> in
ASCII matches any decimal digit. Two ranges may not share an
endpoint, so e.g. <b>a-c-e</b> is illegal. Ranges are very
collating-sequence-dependent, and portable programs should avoid
relying on them.</p>
<p>To include a literal <b>]</b> or <b>-</b> in the list, the
simplest method is to enclose it in <b>[.</b> and <b>.]</b> to make
it a collating element (see below). Alternatively, make it the
first character (following a possible '<b>^</b>'), or precede it
with '<b>\</b>'. Alternatively, for '<b>-</b>', make it the last
character, or the second endpoint of a range. To use a literal
<b>-</b> as the first endpoint of a range, make it a collating
element or precede it with '<b>\</b>'. With the exception of these,
some combinations using <b>[</b> (see next paragraphs), and
escapes, all other special characters lose their special
significance within a bracket expression.</p>
<p>Within a bracket expression, a collating element (a character, a
multi-character sequence that collates as if it were a single
character, or a collating-sequence name for either) enclosed in
<b>[.</b> and <b>.]</b> stands for the sequence of characters of
that collating element.</p>
<p>Within a bracket expression, the name of a <i>character
class</i> enclosed in <b>[:</b> and <b>:]</b> stands for the list
of all characters (not all collating elements!) belonging to that
class. Standard character classes are:</p>
<table>

<td valign="top" width="119"><b>alpha</b></td>
<td valign="top">A letter.</td>

<p><i>wxWidgets</i>: In a non-Unicode build, these character
classifications depend on the current locale, and correspond to the
values return by the ANSI C 'is' functions: isalpha, isupper, etc.
In Unicode mode they are based on Unicode classifications, and are
not affected by the current locale.</p>

<h2>Escapes</h2>
<p>Escapes (AREs only), which begin with a <b>\</b> followed by an
alphanumeric character, come in several varieties: character entry,
class shorthands, constraint escapes, and back references. A
<b>\</b> followed by an alphanumeric character but not constituting
a valid escape is illegal in AREs. In EREs, there are no escapes:
outside a bracket expression, a <b>\</b> followed by an
alphanumeric character merely stands for that character as an
ordinary character, and inside a bracket expression, <b>\</b> is an
ordinary character. (The latter is the one actual incompatibility
between EREs and AREs.)</p>
<p>Character-entry escapes (AREs only) exist to make it easier to
specify non-printing and otherwise inconvenient characters in
REs:</p>

<p>Hexadecimal digits are '<b>0</b>'-'<b>9</b>',
'<b>a</b>'-'<b>f</b>', and '<b>A</b>'-'<b>F</b>'. Octal digits are
'<b>0</b>'-'<b>7</b>'.</p>
<p>The character-entry escapes are always taken as ordinary
characters. For example, <b>\135</b> is <b>]</b> in ASCII, but
<b>\135</b> does not terminate a bracket expression. Beware,
however, that some applications (e.g., C compilers) interpret such
sequences themselves before the regular-expression package gets to
see them, which may require doubling (quadrupling, etc.) the
'<b>\</b>'.</p>
<p>Class-shorthand escapes (AREs only) provide shorthands for
certain commonly-used character classes:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="158"><b>\d</b></td>
<td valign="top"><b>[[:digit:]]</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="158"><b>\s</b></td>
<td valign="top"><b>[[:space:]]</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="158"><b>\w</b></td>
<td valign="top"><b>[[:alnum:]_]</b> (note underscore)</td>

<tr>
<td valign="top" width="158"><b>\W</b></td>
<td valign="top"><b>[^[:alnum:]_]</b> (note underscore)</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Within bracket expressions, '<b>\d</b>', '<b>\s</b>', and
'<b>\w</b>' lose their outer brackets, and '<b>\D</b>',
'<b>\S</b>', and '<b>\W</b>' are illegal. (So, for example,
<b>[a-c\d]</b> is equivalent to <b>[a-c[:digit:]]</b>. Also,
<b>[a-c\D]</b>, which is equivalent to <b>[a-c^[:digit:]]</b>, is
illegal.)</p>
<p>A constraint escape (AREs only) is a constraint, matching the
empty string if specific conditions are met, written as an
escape:</p>
<table>

<tr>
<td valign="top" width="158"><b>\A</b></td>
<td valign="top">matches only at the beginning of the string (see
<a href="resyntax.html#wxresynmatching">Matching</a>, below, for
how this differs from '<b>^</b>')</td>

<td valign="top">matches only at a point that is not the beginning

<td valign="top">(where <i>m</i> is a nonzero digit, and <i>nn</i>
is some more digits, and the decimal value <i>mnn</i> is not
greater than the number of closing capturing parentheses seen so
far) a <i>back reference</i>, see below</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>A word is defined as in the specification of <b>[[:&lt;:]]</b>
and <b>[[:&gt;:]]</b> above. Constraint escapes are illegal within
bracket expressions.</p>
<p>A back reference (AREs only) matches the same string matched by
the parenthesized subexpression specified by the number, so that
(e.g.) <b>([bc])\1</b> matches <b>bb</b> or <b>cc</b> but not
'<b>bc</b>'. The subexpression must entirely precede the back
reference in the RE. Subexpressions are numbered in the order of
their leading parentheses. Non-capturing parentheses do not define
subexpressions.</p>
<p>There is an inherent historical ambiguity between octal
character-entry escapes and back references, which is resolved by
heuristics, as hinted at above. A leading zero always indicates an
octal escape. A single non-zero digit, not followed by another
digit, is always taken as a back reference. A multi-digit sequence
not starting with a zero is taken as a back reference if it comes
after a suitable subexpression (i.e. the number is in the legal
range for a back reference), and otherwise is taken as octal.</p>

<h2>Metasyntax</h2>
<p>In addition to the main syntax described above, there are some
special forms and miscellaneous syntactic facilities available.</p>
<p>Normally the flavor of RE being used is specified by
application-dependent means. However, this can be overridden by a
<i>director</i>. If an RE of any flavor begins with '<b>***:</b>',
the rest of the RE is an ARE. If an RE of any flavor begins with
'<b>***=</b>', the rest of the RE is taken to be a literal string,
with all characters considered ordinary characters.</p>
<p>An ARE may begin with <i>embedded options</i>: a sequence
<b>(?xyz)</b> (where <i>xyz</i> is one or more alphabetic
characters) specifies options affecting the rest of the RE. These
supplement, and can override, any options specified by the
application. The available option letters are:</p>

<p>Embedded options take effect at the <b>)</b> terminating the
sequence. They are available only at the start of an ARE, and may
not be used later within it.</p>
<p>In addition to the usual (<i>tight</i>) RE syntax, in which all
characters are significant, there is an <i>expanded</i> syntax,
available in AREs with the embedded x option. In the expanded
syntax, white-space characters are ignored and all characters
between a <b>#</b> and the following newline (or the end of the RE)
are ignored, permitting paragraphing and commenting a complex RE.
There are three exceptions to that basic rule:</p>
<ul>
<li>a white-space character or '<b>#</b>' preceded by '<b>\</b>' is
retained</li>
<li>white space or '<b>#</b>' within a bracket expression is
retained</li>
<li>white space and comments are illegal within multi-character
symbols like the ARE '<b>(?:</b>' or the BRE '<b>\(</b>'</li>
</ul>
Expanded-syntax white-space characters are blank, tab, newline, and
any character that belongs to the <i>space</i> character class.
<p>Finally, in an ARE, outside bracket expressions, the sequence
'<b>(?#ttt)</b>' (where <i>ttt</i> is any text not containing a
'<b>)</b>') is a comment, completely ignored. Again, this is not
allowed between the characters of multi-character symbols like
'<b>(?:</b>'. Such comments are more a historical artifact than a
useful facility, and their use is deprecated; use the expanded
syntax instead.</p>
<p><i>None</i> of these metasyntax extensions is available if the
application (or an initial <b>***=</b> director) has specified that
the user's input be treated as a literal string rather than as an
RE.</p>
<hr>
<a name="wxresynmatching" id="wxresynmatching"></a>
<h2>Matching</h2>
<p>In the event that an RE could match more than one substring of a
given string, the RE matches the one starting earliest in the
string. If the RE could match more than one substring starting at
that point, its choice is determined by its <i>preference</i>:
either the longest substring, or the shortest.</p>
<p>Most atoms, and all constraints, have no preference. A
parenthesized RE has the same preference (possibly none) as the RE.
A quantified atom with quantifier <b>{m}</b> or <b>{m}?</b> has the
same preference (possibly none) as the atom itself. A quantified
atom with other normal quantifiers (including <b>{m,n}</b> with
<i>m</i> equal to <i>n</i>) prefers longest match. A quantified
atom with other non-greedy quantifiers (including <b>{m,n}?</b>
with <i>m</i> equal to <i>n</i>) prefers shortest match. A branch
has the same preference as the first quantified atom in it which
has a preference. An RE consisting of two or more branches
connected by the <b>|</b> operator prefers longest match.</p>
<p>Subject to the constraints imposed by the rules for matching the
whole RE, subexpressions also match the longest or shortest
possible substrings, based on their preferences, with
subexpressions starting earlier in the RE taking priority over ones
starting later. Note that outer subexpressions thus take priority
over their component subexpressions.</p>
<p>Note that the quantifiers <b>{1,1}</b> and <b>{1,1}?</b> can be
used to force longest and shortest preference, respectively, on a
subexpression or a whole RE.</p>
<p>Match lengths are measured in characters, not collating
elements. An empty string is considered longer than no match at
all. For example, <b>bb*</b> matches the three middle characters of
'<b>abbbc</b>', <b>(week|wee)(night|knights)</b> matches all ten
characters of '<b>weeknights</b>', when <b>(.*).*</b> is matched
against <b>abc</b> the parenthesized subexpression matches all
three characters, and when <b>(a*)*</b> is matched against
<b>bc</b> both the whole RE and the parenthesized subexpression
match an empty string.</p>
<p>If case-independent matching is specified, the effect is much as
if all case distinctions had vanished from the alphabet. When an
alphabetic that exists in multiple cases appears as an ordinary
character outside a bracket expression, it is effectively
transformed into a bracket expression containing both cases, so
that <b>x</b> becomes '<b>[xX]</b>'. When it appears inside a
bracket expression, all case counterparts of it are added to the
bracket expression, so that <b>[x]</b> becomes <b>[xX]</b> and
<b>[^x]</b> becomes '<b>[^xX]</b>'.</p>
<p>If newline-sensitive matching is specified, <b>.</b> and bracket
expressions using <b>^</b> will never match the newline character
(so that matches will never cross newlines unless the RE explicitly
arranges it) and <b>^</b> and <b>$</b> will match the empty string
after and before a newline respectively, in addition to matching at
beginning and end of string respectively. ARE <b>\A</b> and
<b>\Z</b> continue to match beginning or end of string
<i>only</i>.</p>
<p>If partial newline-sensitive matching is specified, this affects
<b>.</b> and bracket expressions as with newline-sensitive
matching, but not <b>^</b> and '<b>$</b>'.</p>
<p>If inverse partial newline-sensitive matching is specified, this
affects <b>^</b> and <b>$</b> as with newline-sensitive matching,
but not <b>.</b> and bracket expressions. This isn't very useful
but is provided for symmetry.</p>

<h2>Replacing text</h2>
<p>The Replace function is used to replace text in a string that
matches a regular expression with alternative text. The replacement
text can include special characters \n, where n is a number, which
represents the nth capture group in the input regular expression,
and \0 or &amp;, which is equivalent to the entire matched string.
To include the backslash or ampersand character literally in the
replacement string, use \\ or \&amp;.</p>
<hr>
<a name="patterns" id="patterns"></a>
<h2>Useful patterns</h2>
<p>Sometimes we want to match regular strings literally without any
characters being treated as special regular expression components.
This can by either prepending the expression with "(?q)", that
is</p>
<p class="Commandexample">$re = "(?q)".$string</p>
<p>or by prepending all non alphanumeric characters with a
backslash ..</p>
<p class="Commandexample">$re = Replace($string,'\W','\\\0')</p>
<p>Similarly, we may want a replacement string to be treated
completely literally. We can ensure this by escaping the \ and
&amp; characters in the string ..</p>
<p class="Commandexample">$replacestring =
Replace($string,'(\\|\&amp;)','\\\0')</p>
