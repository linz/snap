<h1>snap_manager scripting</h1>
<p>The snap manager program uses a scripting language to define
menu options. This can be customised as required. When the program
starts it loads a script called "snap_manager.cfg" located in the
same directory as the snap_manager program. This sets up
the menu options, then looks for additional configuration scripts
in the scripts subdirectory of the program. It will run any scripts
called "*_menu.cfg", and then a script "local.cfg" if it exists.
Local customisations are best installed into the local.cfg file.
All the menu actions are implemented by functions. These functions
can be overwritten in the local configuration to change their
behaviour.</p>

<h2>Constants</h2>
<p>Constants are either string or logical values (true or false). A
non-empty string is equivalent to the logical value true.</p>
<p>String constants are enclosed in quote marks, eg "string". The
may span several lines in a script. They can include "\t" for tab
characters, "\n" for new line, and "\r" for carriage return. Use
"\\" to include the backslash character in the string.</p>
<p>Strings may also include variable names ($name), which will be
substituted with the value of the variable. The name may be
terminated with an additional $ character if necessary to avoid
ambiguity. Use "\$" to include the dollar character in the
string.</p>
<p>Strings can also be quoted with single quotes ('). In this case
the text between the quotes will be returned without any
modification. This text can include any characters except single
quotes.</p>
<p>Finally, strings can be entered as unquoted integer values (one
or more digits).</p>
<hr>
<a name="variables" id="variables"></a>
<h2>Variables</h2>
<p>Variables are named with a leading "$" character followed by
letters, numbers, or underscore characters. For example
"$my_job_file". Some variable have predefined values .. 
see <a href="#sysvar">System variables</a> below. 
Variables starting with "$_" are global variables
... they remain defined until snap_manager terminates. Other
variables exist only for the duration of the script or function in
which they are defined. For example:</p>
<p class="Commandexample">$errorfile = FindJobFile(".err")</p>
<hr>
<a name="functions" id="functions"></a>
<h2>Function calls</h2>
<p>Functions are called by a function name followed by zero or more
parameters in brackets. snap_manager defines a number of <a href=
"script.html#sysfunc">built-in functions</a>. The script can also
define new <a href="script.html#udf">user defined functions</a>.
Examples of function calls are:</p>
<p class="Commandexample">SetConfig("editor","notepad.exe")</p>
<p class="Commandexample">$tempfile = TempFile()</p>
<hr>
<a name="expressions" id="expressions"></a>
<h2>Expressions</h2>
<p>Expressions define values calculated from constants, variables,
and other expressions. Expressions can include the following
operators</p>
<table>
<tr>
<td>.</td>
<td>
<p>String concatenation uses the "." operator. For example</p>
<p class="Commandexample">$name . $extension</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<tr>
<td>+, -, *, /</td>
<td>
<p>Numerical operator -
variables are interpreted as numbers and added, subtracted,
multiplied or divided</p>
</td>
</tr>
<td>not</td>
<td>
<p>Reverses the logical value of an expression. For example</p>
<p class="Commandexample">not FileExists($datafile)</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>and, or</td>
<td>
<p>Logical operators combining variables</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>==, !=</td>
<td>
<p>String comparison operators. Return true when strings are equal
(==), or not equal (!=).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&lt;, &lt;=, &gt;=, &gt;</td>
<td>
<p>Inequality operators, return true if the left operand is less than,
less than or equal to, greater than or equal to, or greater than the right operand.
Comparison of strings is slightly non-intuitive.  The strings are interpreted as 
floating point numbers up to the first non-valid character, then as a string residual.
Comparison is first on the numerical value of the numbers, and if they are the same, 
then on a text based comparison of the residuals.  If the beginning of the string 
cannot be interpreted as a number then the number part is taken to be 0.0, and the 
residual the entire string.
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Expression can be combined with parentheses to define the order
of evaluation, for example</p>
<p class="Commandexample">not ($job_valid and FileExists($binfile)
)</p>
<hr>
<a name="statements" id="statements"></a>
<h2>Statements</h2>
<p>The basic statements of the scripting language are assignment
statements, conditional statements, and loop statements.</p>
<p>Assignment statements assign a value to a variable, using the
"=" operator. For example:</p>
<p class="Commanddefinition">variable = expression</p>
<p>Assignments can also assign multiple values at once, as in</p>
<p class="Commanddefinition">variable1,variable2,.. = expression1,expression2,..</p>
<p>Conditional statements define statements that may or may not be
executed, depending upon some conditions. These are structured
as</p>
<p class="Commanddefinition">if <i>expression</i> then
<i>statements</i> endif</p>
<p>The statement may also define alternative branches using elseif
and else components. For example:</p>
<pre class="Commandexample">
if FileExists($errorfile) then
   if Ask("There were errors in the job\r\nDo you want to see the error file?","Errors") then
      Start($_editor,$errorfile)
   endif
elseif not FileExists($resultfile) then
   Message("Something went wrong!")
else
   Message("The job completed successfully")
endif
</pre>
<p>There are two forms of loop statement. The "while" statement
is</p>
<p class="Commanddefinition">while <i>expression</i> do
<i>statements</i> endwhile</p>
<p>This will execute the statements repeatedly as long as the
expression is true. By default this will iterate a maximum of 100
times if the expression remains true. The maximum number of
iterations can be reset by defining a value for the variable
$max_while_loop_iterations, for example:</p>
<p class="Commanddefinition">$max_while_loop_iterations="3"</p>
<p>The foreach statement has several formats.  It can either be specified with
a set of expressions, as in </p>
<p class="Commanddefinition">foreach <i>variable</i> in
<i>expression1, expression2, ...</i> 
do <i>statements</i> endforeach</p>
<p>In this case the variable will be set to each expression value in turn 
and the statements in the loop are executed.</p>
<p>If just one expression is specified then it is interpreted as a string
and the loop is executed setting the variable to each line in the string 
(delimited by "\n").</p>
<p class="Commanddefinition">foreach <i>variable</i> in
<i>expression</i> do <i>statements</i> endforeach</p>
<p>Each form can be used with a "delimited_by" clause, in which case the string
(or strings if there is more than one expression) will be split using the 
<a href="resyntax.html">regular expression</a> 
defined in the delimited_by clause.  If the expression contains capture
groups then the variable is set to each of these in turn as well as the delimited text.
The format of this is</p>
<p class="Commanddefinition">foreach <i>variable</i> in
<i>expression</i> delimited_by <i>delimiter_expression</i>
do <i>statements</i> endforeach</p>
<p>The final form of the foreach statement finds all substrings within an expression
that matches a regular expression</p>
<p class="Commanddefinition">foreach <i>variable</i> in
<i>expression</i> matches <i>match_expression</i>
do <i>statements</i> endforeach</p>
<p>This will return every occurrence of the the match expression
(again a regular expression) within the string. If the expression
contains capture groups then only the capture groups will be
returned, otherwise the matched strings will be returned.</p>
<p>There are also four exit statements available</p>
<p class="Commanddefinition">continue</p>
<p class="Commanddefinition">break</p>
<p class="Commanddefinition">return <i>expression1, expression2, ...</i></p>
<p class="Commanddefinition">exit</p>
<p>The continue statement applies within a while or foreach loop,
and causes the rest of the statements in the loop to be skipped,
immediately starting the next iteration of the loop. The break
statement terminates the current while or foreach loop. The return
statement exits the current function and specifies the value or values to return. 
The exit statement exits the current script.</p>

<a name="udf" id="udf"></a>
<h2>User defined functions</h2>
<p>User defined functions may be defined with the syntax:</p>
<pre class="Commandexample">
function <i>name</i>( <i>$param1</i>,<i>$param2</i>, ... )
   <i>statements</i>
end_function
</pre>
<p>This is activated by a function call defined which defines the
values of each of the parameters. Any missing parameters are
defined to be empty strings.</p>
<p>The function can include one or more return statements defining
a value to return to the calling script. Otherwise the function
returns the value from the last statement executed.  The return statement
can also multiple values, for example</p>
<pre class="Commandexample">
function <i>minmax</i>( <i>$v1</i>,<i>$v2</i> )
   if $v1 &lt; $v2 then return $v1, $v2 endif
   return $v2, $v1
end_function

$vmin,$vmax=minmax(5,3)
