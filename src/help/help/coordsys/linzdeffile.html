<h1>LINZ deformation file format</h1>
<p>The LINZ deformation model format is used to represent complex
<a href="linzdefmodel.html">deformation fields</a> which can
comprise both an ongoing national deformation model and local
perturbations to this field due to earthquakes or other
deformation.</p>
<p>The deformation file used by SNAP is a binary file format. The
file is generated from a number text files using the
makelinzdefmodel.pl script supplied with SNAP. The main file is an
index file which defines the deformation model, and the deformation
sequences and components of which it comprises (as described in the
<a href="linzdefmodel.html">LINZ deformation model</a>). Each
component is in turn represented by either a <a href=
"gridfile_s.html">gridded data file</a> or <a href=
"trigfile.html">triangulated data file</a>.  Currently LINZ deformation 
models have only used the grid file format - it is likely the 
triangulated file format will be deprecated.</p>
<p>
There have been three versions of the deformation file format.  The 
first version provided basic grids and a simple time model. Version 
2 added support for nested grid formats and more complex time models,
including piecewise linear time models.  Version 3 add support for
multiple versions of the deformation model in one file.
</p>
<p>The index file is structured with a header section followed by
one or more deformation sequences. Each sequence has one or more
deformation components. Each record comprised a code defining the
content of the record, followed by the value of the record. Dates
in the file are formatted as dd-mmm-yyyy, for example
&ldquo;20-Jan-2004&rdquo;. This can optionally be followed by a
time such as &ldquo;12:30&rdquo;</p>
<p>The header section should contain the following records:</p>
<table class="NormalTable">

<p>Each deformation sequence should be followed by one or more
deformation components which define the sequence.</p>
<p>For version 1 deformation type sequences the deformation components
sequences must be defined in ascending order of reference date. The
deformation for the sequence at a given time is then calculated
based upon the components before and after the calculation time. If
the calculation time is before the first or after the last
component of the sequence, then it is calculated using the first or
last component. Note that it is possible to define incompatible
data, for example by specifying a deformation of "zero" after one
deformation component and "interpolate" before the next.</p>
<p>For version 1 velocity type sequences the deformation from each component
is simply added, so the order is unimportant. Usually a velocity
sequence will only have one component.</p>
<p>For version 2 models each component of the sequence is evaluated by default.
However if the sequence is defined as a nested sequence then only the first 
component which includes the evaluation point is calculated.  Subsequent components
of the sequence are ignored. If the sequence is not nested then each component is
evaluated and added.  Each component defines its own time model, which
may be a piecewise linear model (which can also defined step functions) or 
a velocity model.
