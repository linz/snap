<h1><a name="crdsys_refframe_def"></a>Reference frame definition format</h1>

<p>The reference frame definition specifies the ellipsoid for a reference frame, and the location, orientation, and scale of coordinates relative to a reference system.  The reference system is arbitrary.  Conversions can only be done between coordinates which have the same reference system. </p>

<p>Reference frame definitions have the following format in the coordinate system definition file: </p>

<pre><code>
<i>code description</i> ELLIPSOID <i>ellipsoid_code refcode </i>
                 IERS_TSR <i>Tx Ty Tz scale Rx Ry Rz</i>
                 <i>grid_conversion_definition</i>
                 <i>deformation_model_definition</i>
</code></pre>

<pre><code>

<pre><code>
<i>code description</i> ELLIPSOID <i>ellipsoid_code refcode </i>

                 [RATES <i>year0 dTx dTy dTz dRx dRy dRz dscale</i>]
                 <i>grid_conversion_definition</i>
                 <i>deformation_model_definition</i>
</code></pre>

<p>where</p>

<p><i>code</i> is an identifier for the reference frame.  This may contain letters, numbers, and the underscore character.  It cannot contain blanks.  Aliases for the code may be included using "=" to separate 
the codes, for example &quot;NZGD2000=NZGD2000_20170601&quot;. Also codes can be included in brackets,
&quot;NZGD2000_20170601=(20170601)&quot;.  The brackets indicate that the code should not be shown in lists
of reference frames but can be used in reference frames.</p>

<p><i>description</i> is a quoted text description of the reference frame</p>

<p><i>ellipsoid_code</i> is the code for the ellipsoid associated with the reference frame.  This code must have been defined in an earlier [ellipsoids] section of the file.</p>

<p><i>refcode</i> is a code identifying the base reference system in terms of which translations, rotations, scale, and 
deformation are defined.  
This can be the code of another reference frame, or an arbitrary code.  Conversions are possible between 
reference frames with a common base code.  This need not direct.  For example if frame A references frame B, and frames
B and C reference frame D, then conversion between any of the frames is possible.  Circular referencing is not allowed, so if frame A references B, and B reference C, then C cannot reference A or B.  The reference code can be 'NONE',
in which case there is no base reference frame, and the transformation and deformation components cannot be included.</p>

<p>The translations, rotations, and scale change can be expressed using either IERS or NGS conventions.  The main difference is that the sign of the rotation parameters is reversed.  
</p>
<p>For IERS convention definitions the translation, scale, and rotation are the transformations
that must be applied to a coordinate in terms of the reference frame to convert it to a coordinate in terms of the underlying base reference frame.  For the NGS convention, the translation and scale are applied to the coordinates to convert to the base reference frame, but the rotation is reversed.  
</p>
<p>
In the coordsys.def file the convention also affects the units used to express the parameters.
For the IERS convention definitions the units are millimetres (mm) for translations, part per billion (ppb) for scale change, and milli arc seconds (mas) for rotations. 
For NGS convention definitions the units are metres, part per million (ppm) and arc seconds. 
</p>
<p>
IERS conventions are used for definitions using first and second formats above, that is including the literal text &quot;IERS_TSR&quot; or &quot;IERS_ETSR&quot;.
</p>

<p><i>Tx Ty Tz</i> is XYZ position of the origin of the reference frame in the reference system (i.e. the translation that must be applied to coordinates to convert them back to the reference system).  The coordinates are in mm for IERS format transformations or metres
for NGS format transformations. </p>

<p><i>Rx Ry Rz</i> are the rotations about the X, Y, and Z axes required to convert coordinates from the reference frame back to the reference system.   The rotations are in milli arc seconds for IERS format transformations or arc seconds for NGS format transformations.</p>

<p><i>scale</i> is the scale difference between the reference frame and the reference system.  It is applied to coordinates to convert them back to the reference system.  The scale is defined in parts per billion for IERS format transformations or parts per million for NGS format transformations.</p>

<p><i>RATES</i> is an optional section for NGS format transformations defining the rates of change of the transformation components.</p>

<p><i>year0</i> is the date at which the transformation applies as a decimal year.</p>

<p><i>dTx dTy dTz</i> are the rates of change of the transformation components.</p>

<p><i>dRx dRy dRz</i> are the rates of change of the transformation components.</p>

<p><i>dscale</i> is the rate of change of the transformation components.</p>

<p><i>grid_conversion_definition</i> defines a grid based conversion between the base reference frame and this one.  The grid model is applied in addition to the seven parameter transformation.  Currently only one format of grid conversion is defined:
</p>

<pre><code>
GRID SNAP2D <i>filename</i> <i>description</i>
</code></pre>
<p>where <i>filename</i> is the name of the <a href="gridfile_c.html">grid file</a> containing the grid defining
the latitude and longitude offsets to be applied, and <i>description</i> is a text description of the model.</p>

<p><i>deformation_model_definition</i> defines a deformation model that applies for the datum.  The deformation model is used to convert coordinates between different epochs and to convert coordinates to the base reference frame.  
Converting coordinates requires defining a reference epoch at which the model is to be evaluated.  The deformation
calculated at that epoch is added to the coordinates to convert to the base reference frame coordinates.
The definition is structured as: 
</p>

<pre><code>
DEFORMATION <i>type</i> <i>parameters</i>
</code></pre>

<p>Here <i>type</i> is the type of deformation model to use.  
There are currently four model types supported by concord and SNAP. These are <p>
<pre><code>
VELGRID <i>grid_file_name</i> <i>reference_epoch</i><br />
LINZDEF <i>def_model_file</i>
BW14 <i>reference_epoch dTx dTy dTz dRx dRy dRz dS</i> 
EULER <i>reference_epoch Plon Plat rate</i>
NONE
</code></pre>
<p>
The VELGRID model is a gridded velocity model defining the east and north
components of velocities on the grid in metres per year.  It requires a reference epoch which 
defines the time at which the deformation is zero.
</p>
<p>
The LINZDEF model is a <a href="linzdefmodel.html">complex model</a> comprising 
multiple components.  This has just one parameter, the name of the model definition file.  
Coordinates in the 
This does not necessarily correspond to actual coordinates at any real epoch.  
For NZGD2000 this would be the reference coordinates used to refer to a mark.
</p>
<p>The BW14 and EULER models are both equivalent to 14 parameter Bursa Wolf transformations and can be implemented in the transformation
definition section (with RATES or IERS_ETSR).  The EULER model does provide a convenient alternative formulation however.
</p>
<p>
The BW14 model adds a rate change to the Bursa Wolf model. It has parameters of a reference epoch, at which the deformation is zero, and translation rates (mm/year), rotation rates (msec/year), and scale change rate (ppb/year). 
</p>
<p>
The EULER model calculates deformation based on a Euler rotation pole and rate.  It has parameters of a reference epoch at which the deformation is zero, the longitude and latitude of the pole (in degrees), and the rotation rate in msec/year.
</p>
