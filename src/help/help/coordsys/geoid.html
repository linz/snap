<h1>Geoid grid files</h1>

<p>For conversions between ellipsoidal and orthometric
height a file of geoid heights is used. This is a binary file which defines
the geoid heights at a grid of points. The heights at points of interest are
calculated by interpolating from the grid points. Geoid heights represent the
height of sea level above the ellipsoid defined by a reference frame, and so
depend upon the reference frame being used. The geoid binary file defines the
coordinate system for which the heights have been calculated. This system must
be defined in the coordsys.def file in order for concord to convert the
heights into the input and output reference frames.</p>

<p>The default name for the geoid file is
geoid.grd. If a different file name is used the file can be specified either
by setting an environment variable GEOIDBIN to the name of the file, or by
specifying the name of the file on the command line with the -G switch. The
format of the geoid file is defined in the following section.</p>

<p>Snap and concord come with three gridded geoid models</p>

<table>

<tr><td><p>nzgeoid2016.grd</p></td><td>
<p>The New Zealand Geoid 2016 geoid model.  This is generally accurate
to within about 4cm.  It is applicable in the vicinity of New Zealand only.
The model has been gridded at a 1" spacing.
</p>
</td></tr>

<tr><td><p>nzgeoid09.grd</p></td><td>
<p>The New Zealand Geoid 2009 geoid model.  This is generally accurate
to within about 10cm.  It is applicable in the vicinity of New Zealand only.
The model has been gridded at a 1" spacing.
</p>
</td></tr>

<tr><td><p>egm96.grd</p></td><td>
<p>The EGM96 model.  This is a global gravity model which is generally 
accurate to within 1m.  The model has been gridded has been calculated at a 15" spacing.
</p>
</td></tr>
