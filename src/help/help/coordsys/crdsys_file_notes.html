<h1><a name="crdsys_notes_format"></a>Coordinate system notes format</h1>

<p>The <a href="crdsys_file_format.html">coordinate system definition file</a> can define textual notes
associated with each coordinate system, reference frame, and with conversions between them.
This can include notes about coordinate systems not defined in the file (for example explaining why they are
not defined), and about conversions that are not possible (explaining why not).
</p>

<p>
These are defined in sections
</p>

<pre>[reference_frame_notes]
<i>reference frame notes</i>

[coordinate_system_notes]
<i>coordinate system notes</i></code></pre>

<p>
Within each section the notes are organised as:

<pre><i>code1 code2 code3...
First line of notes
Second line of notes
...</i>
end_note</pre>

<p>The first line of each note defines the coordinate systems or reference frames that the note applies to.
It can also define conversion between coordinate systems or reference frames as <i>code1:code2</i>.
This will apply for transformations from system <i>code1</i> to <i>code2</i>.  It will also apply to the
reverse transformation, unless a note is explicitly defined for it.
</p>
<p>The codes line is followed by the text of the note, which may use as many lines as required, 
and then a final line with just the text &quot;end_note&quot;.
</p>
