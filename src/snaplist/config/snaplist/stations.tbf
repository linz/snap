! Configuration file for snaplist

! Anything between text and end_text gets printed verbatim

text
end_text

! Define angle format (essentially defines strings appearing after degrees,
! minutes, and seconds).  See below for defining strings.  The first character
! is used as a delimiter between the strings)
!
! The angle format can be varied throughout the configuration file.  Each
! angle column in a table uses the most recent format defined.

angle_format ###\xF8##'##"


! Define a table.... between table and end_table
! There can be more than one table in the output.  Each table definition
! must include the commands "data", "delimiter", and at least one "column"
! command.

table

! data definition is required.  Currently this must specify gps station.

data gps

! Specify the column delimiter.  The default is a tab character.
! Use \ for no delimiter.  You can also use "tab", "blank", and "comma".
! Or you can enter a string as defined below.
!
! Also you can define the quote character

delimiter tab
quote "

! Specify the output columns.  Each column is formatted as
!   column field_name options
! where field_name is the name of the information to print, and options
! provide formatting information.
!
! Valid column names are:
!   from               From station code
!   to                 To station code
!   obs_ell_dist       Observed ellipsoidal distance
!   calc_ell_dist      Calculated ellipsoidal distance
!   ell_dist_err       Error in ellipsoidal distance
!   ppm_ell_dist_err   Ppm error "  "  "
!   rf_ell_dist_err    RF error  "  "  "
!   hor_vec_err        Length of error in horizontal component of vector
!   ppm_hor_vec_err    ditto as ppm of horizontal length of vector
!   obs_prj_brng       Observed projection bearing
!   calc_prj_brng      Calculated projection bearing
!   prj_brng_err       Error in projection bearing (in seconds)
!   ppm_prj_brng_err   Ppm error "  "  "
!   rf_prj_brng_err    RF error  "  "  "
!   rf_hor_vec_err     ditto as RF
!
! Options for columns are as follows:
!   width=###          Output width
!   align=##           Alignment of field in column (left, centre, or right)
!   ndp=#              Number of decimal places to print
!   quote              Field is quoted
!   prefix=...         Printed in front of the field (outside the quotes)
!   suffix=...         Printed behind the field (outside the quotes);
!   header=...         Defines the column header.  See below for definition
!                      of string formatting.  For multiline headers separate
!                      lines by \n  (new line)
! Options must be as a single string with no enclosed spaces.  For spaces
! in headers use the underscore character (see below).
