! Define angle format (essentially defines strings appearing after degrees,
! minutes, and seconds).  See below for defining strings.  The first character
! is used as a delimiter between the strings)
!
! The angle format can be varied throughout the configuration file.  Each
! angle column in a table uses the most recent format defined.

! Define a table.... between table and end_table

! Specify the column delimiter.  The default is a tab character.
! Use \ for no delimiter.  You can also use "tab", "blank", and "comma".
! Or you can enter a string as defined below.

! Definition of strings
!
! The angle_format, delimiter, and quote commands and the header option
! of the column command all require strings to be input.  In these strings
! the \ and _ characters are treated specially.
!
! The underscore is replaced by a blank in the output.
! The backslash is used to enter "escape sequences", which are characters
! that cannot be entered conveniently into the string.  Valid escape
! sequences are:
!    \b   Print a blank (same as _)
!    \n   Print a new line
!    \t   Print a tab character
!    \x## Print the character with hex value ##
! Any other character after a backslash is printed literally. So
!    \\   Prints a backslash
!    \_   Prints an underscore
